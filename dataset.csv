Moves are being made. And not the ones being thrown down on the dance floor on Saturday night. Though, those are fun, too.
LUXMII Linen is now the over-the-moon happy owner of a production house in Portugal. It‚Äôs a big move that will skyrocket our high quality even higher.
Designs will now be produced in micro batches which means we only produce exactly what we need without any waste.
Every piece is hand cut by artisan tailors who are true experts at what they do and just happen to be our friends, too.
Who says you can't have it all? We are here to accept the challenge and prove that you can balance a successful business alongside a commitment to quality and sustainability. Loyal customers and caffeine help the balance.
Meet Ateli√™ de LUXMII. Bonus points for correct pronunciation. Our very own production house and dispatch facility in Portugal, Europe. It is now where all LUXMII Linen pieces will be designed, cut, packed and shipped ‚Äî which is rare in the modern fashion business.
By upgrading our operations, we will have more control over how we create clothes. Moving allows us to work closely with our artisan tailors and develop stronger connections with our fabric suppliers, enhancing the quality of LUXMII pieces to sumptuous new heights.
In the spirit of transparency, we are excited to hand you the keys (metaphorically) and show you around as we set a new standard for quality. So you can see the extra time, precision and attention to detail that goes into every garment.
Most brands, when they grow, push harder and faster, and ultimately, what starts to fall is the quality of their products. But we are taking a more unconventional path to success that does not compromise.
We are bucking trends and going the other way. As we grow, we are paying even more attention to the quality of our garments because we know it is what makes us special.
Moving our operations to Portugal allows us to have a very hands-on approach at each step of the production process, guaranteeing greater quality on all levels as we continue to perfect our craft. It is a lifelong commitment and a new home, not a one-off summer romance.
Ateli√™ de LUXMII is where we have nurtured a close connection with fabric supply chain partners and talented artisans. So now we can focus on what is most important to us, creating consciously-made linens defined by their flawless quality.
LUXMII Linen is saying yes to exquisite artisan-made linens and a big NOPE to mass, bulk-produced fast fashion where the stitching unravels after the first wash. For those that don't fit the typical size range, say yes to custom sizing solutions. Our talented tailors can create a fit that works for you.
Why are we telling you?
Ateli√™ de LUXMII is going to deliver plenty of benefits for our customers. There are so many we have had to make a list.
- Outstanding quality: making everything in-house means our pieces will be created by talented artisans who are like family to us. They live and breathe their craft infusing extra skill and time into every stitch. We are elevating the quality of our pieces with traditional cutting methods and French seams that create a smooth, luxurious finish.
- No bulk stock: we are serious about creating more sustainable, conscious fashion. LUXMII Linen designs will be produced in micro-batches and made to order so that very little stock will be held at our Low inventory means we have completely eliminated one of the most negative issues in the fashion industry ‚Äî deadstock. With most deadstock ending up in landfill, we are extra proud of this fact.
- Faster Shipping: after you click ‚Äúorder‚Äù, our production team jumps to work and creates your items on the spot. Expected shipping times will be even faster than they are now once your order is cut, sewn and packed, as we have upgraded to the fastest service.
- Reducing carbon footprint: we are consolidating our supply chain to bring you a more conscious, sustainable end product. All LUXMII pieces will now be designed, produced, packed and shipped from one location, our Ateli√™ in Portugal.
- Greater customer care: a better customer experience is here because our team will be right at the source of both production, customer care and shipping.
- More new designs that you love: Fresh new styles in our core fabrics will be launched every month. Just another benefit of keeping operations in-house. Our team will be on the ground in the middle of the action. So, you can shop more of what you love as we get direct feedback. Play the tape back. Remember when we said you could have it all? Because we only produce in line with customer demand, there is no waste or guilt, unlike fast fashion. Happy shopping.
What‚Äôs the Ateli√™ de LUXMII process?
Owning our own production house gives us the control to oversee every part of the production process, from fabric to fit to stitches. Call us passionate or controlling, but we are beyond excited to perfect the quality of our garments to whole new levels.
Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown of the process for anyone still reading. There are, hopefully, still a few. Keep in mind every step is happening in one place, Ateli√™ de LUXMII, which isn‚Äôt common.
- Organic-certified linen from the Netherlands, France and Italy (the gold medallists of linen fabric production) arrives at our production house in Portugal.
- Talented seamstresses, pattern makers and tailors create LUXMII designs from our certified linen.
- Once the pieces have been quality tested by our team, they are packed and shipped off to our customers.
Warehouse Sale
We‚Äôve got a secret to tell you. LUXMII Linen is about to have a warehouse sale.
As anyone who has been through the ordeal of moving knows, it is stressful. That includes those of us who get coffees for the people actually doing the moving. That is why we are having a warehouse sale to clear all existing stock.

Form-fitting and fuss-free, a fitted top makes you look like you're on top of your to-list and ready to meet new clients. Ours features ribbing for extra texture and interest. Tuck it into tailored linen trousers with a belt to smarten up the look.

Linen Vest
Ready to dazzle? A matching suit set will impress without any stress on your part. Wearing it is as easy as relaxing in a freshly laundered bed before the sun sets.
Tackle the suiting trend like a true fashion pro with our linen vest. For the warmer months, wear it on its own with matching tailored trousers. Or when the temperatures drop, transform it into a three-piece with a black blazer and black linen pants.
Add some extra spunk by styling with pointed leather boots. Or tie a silk scarf around your neck to soften the all-black look and create an original outfit no one else will be wearing.
Workwear Lifesavers
Professional aesthetic
You'll usually be office-approved by dressing at least 50% formal. A crisp linen shirt is always polished and gives you the freedom to go a little more low-key on the bottom. You can pair yours with white coloured denims and black jeans to get the tick of approval for even the strictest of office dress codes.
Neutral colour palette
You absolutely cannot lose with black and white workwear outfits. These always say you're professional, put-together and know what you're doing. But also, don't be scared of pops of colour. Those extra bursts of fun can help drag you into the office, even if you'd rather take the day off.
A crisp white button-down shirt is a must
Versatile and classic, this one of the best linen shirts to add to your collection. A clean white linen shirt seamlessly matches almost any outfit and adds a professional feeling to even the most casual of bottoms. It pays to go with shirts in natural fabrics for extra breathability and longevity.
Comfort is key
You have to look at least somewhat presentable in your office uniform for about 8 hours a day. Throw in commuting and dealing with stressful meetings, and you'll want to make sure you're comfortable. Shoes should fit well, and nothing should be too tight or restrictive. Try new outfits on the night before so there aren't any surprises when you get to the office.
A shirt dress is a winner
This one's for those mornings when you're brain still hasn't turned on after the 2nd cup of coffee. A shirt dress is the perfect office-appropriate length and looks all things fashionable and modern. The best part? No thinking is involved. All you have to do is pair with heels or loafers, and you're ready to be out the door.
Have fun with the accessories
Lighten up when styling your workwear outfits with funky statement pieces that reflect your personality and make you feel more like yourself. Accessories are also an easy way to make casual looks office-ready. For example, throwing on a pair of heels or knee-high boots with linen capri pants instantly creates a more put-together look.
Loafers are your best friend
They'll make your feet look ultra stylish, all with the comfort of a sneaker. Plus, they're everywhere at the moment. Celebrities, it girls and the fashion crowd are all whizzing around the cities in a pair of loafers.
Keep a chic cardigan at your desk
The ACs at work are as hard to predict as the Instagram algorithm. Who knows what's going on. Sometimes, it's freezing, and the next minute, the office has turned into a tropical jungle. Always be prepared to layer by keeping a neutral-coloured cardigan or linen button-down at your desk, just in case.
Why Is Linen A Superstar In The Office?
1. thermo-regulating
Linen's really wonderful. If it's warm, linen keeps you cool. And when it's cold, linen helps you warm up. Sounds perfect for the office.
2. sweat-wicking:
Who's got time to have a midday shower? But with the long hours and crazy deadlines in a work day, sometimes one would be lovely. Linen is sweat-wicking and the coolest fabric around. It naturally draws moisture and sweat away from the skin, keeping you fresh however life tries to bring you down. Stuck in traffic and late for work? You'll stay cool in a linen shirt.
3. symbol of luxury
The office uniform is pared-back and minimalistic, so there's nowhere for a poor fabric to hide. There's something more magical about the way natural materials drape on the body. Well-cut pieces in the finest linen will always look better than synthetics.
Conclusion: Best Linen Shirts To Create Flawless Workwear Looks
These are the best linen shirts to make an impression at the workplace and look your most confident, business savvy and professional. First, you'll dazzle everyone with your office uniform, then with your creativity and ideas.
These are the secrets to remember when styling your linen shirts for a business environment:
- Natural fabrics are superior: it's almost like linen was designed, especially with long office days in mind. Not just soft and comfortable, it will keep you fresher for longer thanks to its sweat-wicking and breathable properties.
- A white button-down is a classic: on those busy days when there‚Äô no time to think, going for the classics makes everything easier. A freshly ironed white linen shirt transforms almost any bottoms into a work-ready outfit in seconds. Plus, the outfit combinations from one shirt are endless.
- Neutral colours rule: blacks, whites, and soft neutrals are classics for a reason and should go-tos for the office. Build your wardrobe with most of these colours. Then, add pops of colour and personality with a few bright pieces that match seamlessly with neutrals.
- Let polished accessories help you: often overlooked, accessories can make or break the feeling of an outfit. Tucking a linen shirt into trousers and adding a belt is an inexpensive way to smarten up a look. Or add dainty gold jewellery and a slicked-backed bun to crisp white linens, and you'll instantly boost the professional feel of an outfit.",Office Edit: Best Linen Shirts To Create Flawless Workwear Looks,Discover the best linen shirts for work.

Cotton vs linen. Which fabric is going to get you the most compliments?
Before we drift off into the land of z‚Äôs, patiently waiting for our skincare to kick in and work its magic‚Äîthere‚Äôs a question that plagues us.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for breakfast tomorrow?‚Äù No, although we‚Äôre not immune from dreaming about fresh blueberry smoothies and bottomless brunches. For us fabric snobs that only sleep in silky soft PJs, the big lurking debate is linen vs cotton.
To settle the question once and for all, we‚Äôre looking at all the details. Weaknesses, differences and similarities. No beautifully polished stones will be left unturned in our investigation of these high-end natural fabrics.
You probably already know what side we‚Äôre on‚Äîthe right side. (psst, it starts with the same letter as the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù, which is what we feel when wearing this easy textile).
By the end of this blog, we‚Äôre hoping to see all of you fashion lovers on our team. The team that‚Äôs wonderfully breezy, uniquely textured and always looks classy.
What Is Linen?
Let's get nerdy for a second. What is linen? It's a textile made from the stem of the flax plant.
Linen is a true symbol of slow living and craftsmanship, with the journey from plant to linen clothing quite complex and time-consuming. The best part? Some stages of production are still done by hand.
Flax is very rigid and tough and can be challenging to weave when first pulled from the ground. It must be stored for a long time to soften it. Then once it's soft enough, it's woven into the luxurious fabric that' beloved by all stylish women.
When we say linen is timeless, we really mean it. Some of the oldest flax fibres discovered are 30,000 years old and originate from ancient Egypt. There it was used as clothing, currency and wrapping for mummies. If it's good enough for Pharaohs and queens, it's good enough for us.
Where Is Linen Grown?
Linen is predominantly grown in Europe and Asia, with European weaving mills famous for their premium quality.
Currently, most linen comes from China. The second largest producer of linen in the world is Italy.
What Is Cotton?
Cotton fabric comes from the cotton plant ‚Äî simple. Specifically, its produced from the boll, the fluffy part of the plant. All that fluffy goodness is then spun and woven into fabric.
Linen vs Cotton: The Similarities
The linen vs cotton question is more of a friendly sibling rivalry than anything serious. Both textiles are beloved worldwide and actually share some key similarities. Here are the most important ones:
Both are Natural Textiles
Linen and cotton are both natural textiles. When it comes to fabrics that don't irritate the skin and feel uber-luxurious, natural is always best. Plus, they both have the advantage of being biodegradable and hypoallergenic. We love a fabric that can do both ‚Äî be gentle on the environment and our skin.
Both are breathable
On a sweltering day, there's nothing like a linen slip dress. Now science backs us up with proof that both linen and cotton are highly breathable. The flax plant is hollow and allows water and air to move freely, giving linen its delightful breezy characteristics.
But, the breathability of cotton is dependent on how loose the weave of the fabric is. You can have highly dense cotton fabrics like denim that aren't very breathable.
Both are water absorbent
Ever wondered why you feel so fresh and cool when wearing linen? (Puts on glasses and checks notes).
Linen's a highly water-absorbent fabric that can hold up to 20% of its own weight in water. That's why linen never feels sticky on the skin, even when the humidity rises. Cotton can hold up to 25% of its weight in water.
Linen vs Cotton: The Differences
Linen Is More Durable
Who would win in an arm wrestle between linen and cotton? Theoretically, linen, if fabric, had arms. It's approximately 30% stronger than cotton. Why? Linens' fibres are longer and more tightly woven than cotton, making them extra strong and durable.
Live, laugh and dine in your linen tops without any worries. The textile only gets better and softer with every wash.
When cared for correctly, it can last for decades and decades‚Äîperfect for time capsules or passing clothes down to daughters. While cotton clothing is gorgeous, too, it can often lose its original sparkle after a few years.
Linen Is More Eco-Friendly
Both fabrics are natural but have very different environmental footprints. These are some of the major positives of linen:
- Zero-Waste: all parts of the flax plant can be used to create valuable things such as textiles, food, seeds and oil. This means that there's no waste in the production of linen. We love a guilt-free purchase.
- Low Water Use: producing linen uses the least amount of water and energy compared to all the other natural fibres. Linen requires 400% less water than cotton and 400% less stress.
- Natural Cultivation: growing linen's easier than trying to keep an indoor plant alive. Why? It's a super low-maintenance crop (can't say the same for us!). There's no need for artificial irrigation, pesticides or chemicals when growing or producing linen fibres. So linen gets an A+ for style as well as an A+ for sustainability.
- Gentle Carbon Footprint: flax crops absorb carbon dioxide. 300 hectares of our LUXMII Linens can absorb the emissions of 1,000 cars. And save you 111 times when you don't know what to wear.
Linen Is Naturally Moisture-Wicking
Still, a fence-sitter when it comes to linen? This next one will turn you into a lover.
Linen is naturally moisture-wicking, drawing moisture and sweat away from the skin. You'll feel cool even if you've been running errands all day and carrying bags and bags of shopping.
Cotton can also wick moisture, but not as expertly as linen. In fact, the stats show that people dressed in linen sweat less than people wearing cotton. Looking fresh without trying? Sign us up.
Linen Is Thermo-Regulating
Linen is the most thermo-regulating fabric you can find. That's a fancy way of saying it's a master at controlling temperature. So it keeps us cool when it's warm and warm when it's cool. That's another reason to wear linen all year round.
Sounds like science fiction? It's possible because when the temps drop, the linen fibres contract and trap the warm air. This helps your body warm itself up naturally.
When it's a picture-perfect sunny day, the linen fibres expand and create more space for the air to move around freely and keep you cool.
Cotton Has A Smoother Finish
In the smooth stakes, cotton wins. Compared to linen, it has a smoother and softer finish. Although because of its weaker fibres, it has a tendency to pill more than linen.
Linen has a reputation for being on the rougher side due to its looser weave. Picture us without our morning coffee. But this special texture gives linen more character and a unique one-of-a-kind feeling. Plus, it makes it easier to skip the iron.
What Colour Is Linen?
From earthy tones, to blush pinks and rich blues, linen comes in a dazzling array of colours. Like most natural textiles, it can absorb dyes well, much better than most synthetics. So what colour is linen?
Undyed linen's natural colour is called ""linen grey"". That's not your standard grey. It's greyish with warm brown and cream undertones. But, as with all things from the natural world, it can vary, and every linen fabric is unique.
At LUXMII Linen, we wanted to celebrate the natural colour of linen with a collection that's completely undyed. Take a peek at our all-natural Oia Bell Sleeved Linen Wrap Top and matching linen pants.
Conclusion: Linen vs Cotton
Order in vs dine out? Cardio vs yoga? These are the big questions swirling around in our brains. We can't answer them all, so today we've tackled linen vs cotton.
Both are premium natural textiles that are breathable, hypoallergenic and lightweight ‚Äî all the things on our wish list. But if there can only be one winner, we're on the sidelines, shaking pom poms and cheering on linen.
The perfect linen wrap dress is our trusty go-to when we're hoping for a flawless look. Here are linen's other pluses over cotton:
- Linen is long-lasting: don‚Äôt worry about overwearing your favourite linen pieces. Linen‚Äôs fibres are longer and more tightly woven than cotton making them super durable and long-lasting.
- Linen is super-sustainable: biodegradable, renewable and recyclable, linen ticks all the good boxes. It also requires 400% less water than cotton and no pesticides or chemicals. Not only does it look stylish, but a flax crop can also even absorb emissions. Love!
- Linen is thermo-regulating & moisture-wicking: linen‚Äôs one of those gals that can do it all. It can keep you cool on hot days and warm when it gets chillier. Its moisture-wicking and thermo-regulating properties make us feel fresh and cool when wearing linen.",Cotton vs Linen: Why We Love Linen?,"Cotton vs linen. Weaknesses, differences and similarities.

We know why your linen clothing keeps wrinkling, and we'll tell you how to fix it.

The secret to keeping linen wrinkle-free is all in the details. Little adjustments at every step of the process will help to give you a crisp look in the end. We'll cover how to wash, iron and hang your linen in the right way so it looks stunning.
Extra TLC to eliminate stubborn creases will pay off big time. Read on to find out how to keep linen from wrinkling with quick and easy tips that you can do even when you're in a rush.
Life-Changing Tips On How To Keep Linen From Wrinkling
Don‚Äôt overload the washing machine
Give your linen clothing plenty of space when washing to minimise wrinkles. It also ensures your pieces will stay in gorgeous condition for longer.
Be quick when taking your linens out of the washing machine
Looks like a small thing, but it will make a massive difference to how smooth your linens will be in the end. It seems like every extra minute your linen pieces spend in the machine ‚Äî they end up twisting themselves with the flexibility of an Olympic gymnast.
Dry your linens flat
Or air them out to dry on the line. Give them a good shake before hanging. You'll be stunned at how many creases smooth out naturally just by following this quick tip. In the end, it will also save you time on ironing.
Iron your linens while they‚Äôre still damp for best results
Plus, you won't need an Iron Man arm to iron out the wrinkles. Guaranteed to give you a smooth finish in minutes.
A quality steamer will be your everyday hero
Can't rave enough about how quickly steamers remove creases without damaging the clothing. There's a reason fashion designers swear by them.
Be extra careful how you sit & move
Straighten up a linen skirt or pants before you sit down to help minimise wrinkles. Try to unbutton linen jackets before sitting, or better yet, hang them over a chair. We may remember the first few times but then forget and start daydreaming about what it would be like to permanently move to St. Tropez ‚Äî so the extra reminder always helps.
Wear linens with prints
Linen pieces featuring stripes or prints do an excellent job of hiding wrinkles. If all else fails, go for a printed linen shirt; no one will even know you haven't used an iron.
Why Does Linen Wrinkle?
Love the breezy fit of linen? Hate the way many synthetics stick to the skin in balmy temperatures? The reason why linen is so breathable and lightweight is also why it gets a bit wrinkly. We think that's a fair deal for the endless chic it so kindly gives us. Plus, the wrinkles are what makes linen so charming.
Let's cut the fabric that gives us billowy summer dresses and the ultimate holiday wardrobe some slack. Linen never has to try too hard; she just has to show up, and she's best dressed.
Why does linen tend to wrinkle, though? It‚Äôs made from the flax plant, which has stiff cellulose fibres. These don't have as much elasticity as other fabrics, and so don't bounce back into shape once the fabric is folded or creased.
Luckily, minimising the wrinkles in linen clothing shouldn't cause too many headaches, especially if you follow the advice we've set out in this blog. Good luck!
How To Wash Linen To Keep It Wrinkle-Free
When it comes to washing linen, it's only good news. There's no need for dry cleaning. You can do the washing from home. Unless it's a suit, then it's best to go with professionals.
Let's keep the positives coming. To wash linen, all you need is a washing machine and mild detergent. It really is that easy.
Simply pop your linens into a gentle, short cycle with a temperature of 30C, and you'll be ready to don your favourite pieces just like that. Make sure to avoid overloading the washing machine, though; linen loves her personal space.
If you shudder at the thought of doing laundry, linen's on your side. She's an elegant lady and ages gracefully. The more you wash her, the softer and smoother she becomes. So as time goes on, the less you'll have to worry about wrinkles. Perfection. Our skincare wishes she could do that.
Important tip alert. Keep an eye on the time when your linens are in the washing machine. Try to take them out as soon as the cycle finishes.

If you're after crisp-looking linen tops, you'll have to get the iron out. Who would have thought?
No worries on that front, though. Ironing linen is easy as long as you follow some simple rules. The top rule is to iron when the linen is damp. The creases haven't set yet, so smoothing them out is as easy as online shopping (something that comes naturally to us).
If your clothing has already dried, it's not a big problem. Simply get a spray water bottle and lightly spritz your linen.
For all the must-know details on how to iron linen, visit our blog that covers it all.
Best Way To Hang Linen To Minimise Wrinkles
The last thing anyone wants is to labour over the washing and ironing of linen to hang them incorrectly.
It's as if all your previous work was for nothing. You'd have been better off soaking it up in a bubble bath with essential oils and all. Obviously, you can choose the bath option as a reward after all that laundry.
To avoid the above horror, carefully hang your linens so they look sensational when you next need to wow at an event. The best possible way to hang a linen blouse is on padded hangers. This cuts out any possibility of creasing, and the padding minimises any fabric stretch. The same goes for linen dresses if you can.
Linen trousers should be folded in half lengthwise. Then gently draped across a hanger or folded into a drawer. If you're out of wooden or padded hangers, gently folding is your next best option. Try to minimise the amount of creases.
A Steamer Is Gold
Any creases from folding can be steamed out before you wear them. A steamer is perfect for when you need a specific item of clothing to look smooth on short notice. Just steam, and you're ready to roll.
Plus, a steamer makes for a very handy travelling companion. Throw one into your suitcase. But how to pack linen to keep it wrinkle-less is a whole other topic.
What Linen Wrinkles The Least?
Linen's renowned for its laidback, nonchalant elegance. That wouldn't be possible without its unique texture and slightly crumpled finish.
Yet, there are situations where a very crisp look is called for. Important meetings come to mind. Luckily, there are solutions. Going for linen fabric with hints of cotton will create a smoother finish without the help of an iron.
Looking for delightfully breathable trousers that stay wrinkle-free? However many times you get up to use the office coffee machine, our Piega Linen Trousers will stay crisp and smooth.
They're meticulously tailored from 50% organic linen and 50% organic cotton. These beauties are handmade in Greece, and slipping into them for the day feels as good as not checking your emails.
Conclusion: How To Keep Linen From Wrinkling
Just like the adorable folds and rolls of skin on puppies, we find the soft creases on linen clothing oh so lovely. Smoothing them out, though, is very doable and easy. Just follow these tips on how to keep linen from wrinkling:
- Avoid stuffing your washing machine when washing linens. Giving your pieces a little extra room in the machine will help big time if you don't want wrinkles.
- Don't forget about your linen clothing in the washing machine. As soon as the washing cycle is finished, try to take your linens out. So any wrinkles don't dry.
- Iron linen clothing when it's damp. Once creases are dried into the fabric, they're harder to remove. Spritz lightly with water if your linens have already dried.
- Start steaming. If you need to remove wrinkles or creases in a flash, a top-quality steamer is your best bet. There's no downtime. You can wear your linens straight after steaming.
- Embrace the wrinkled look. This is our favourite tip, the crumples on linen are a big part of its magic.

If, more than handbag sales or happy hour, you wish for crisply folded bed sheets, labelled shelves and perfectly arranged pillows, then this blog on how to organize a linen closet will be right up your clean-freak alley.
Got Marie Kondo on speed dial? We‚Äôll show you how to organize a linen closet so that it looks like the organization aficionado herself just swept through the space with her magical wand.
You‚Äôll transform your closet into an oasis of order and calm. No more overflowing drawers and old towels only a mother could love. Welcome to clean o‚Äôclock.
What Goes In A Linen Closet?
Linen‚Äôs much more than just linen tops and linen trousers. When it comes to the linen closet, these are the items most commonly stored:
- beddding ‚Äì sheets, covers, blankets and pillows
- towels
- tablecloths and napkins
- cleaning products
- extra general supplies like toilet paper
- First Aid kit
STEPS: How To Organize A Linen Closet
These are the key steps to take if you‚Äôre ready to organize your linen closet like the pros.
For those that need extra motivation (us!), picture all the time you‚Äôll save in the long run and treat yourself after all the hard work. All we‚Äôre saying is we‚Äôll clean like a whiz if someone drops off some fresh pastries.
- Empty your closet
- Measure the space carefully
- Take a hard look at your stuff and then declutter
- Store everyday essentials in easy-to-reach places
- Like items go with like items
- Organize items seasonally
Step 1. Take everything out of the closet
When we say everything, we mean everything. Your closet should be even more empty than the fridge when it‚Äôs your turn to cook dinner. Starting from scratch lets you know what you‚Äôre working with, how much junk you‚Äôve accumulated, and it helps eventually turn your closet into a masterpiece.
Step 2. Measure your space
Time to get the measuring tape out and measure all the different nooks and corners of your closet. It‚Äôll help give you the closet of your dreams because any baskets, containers or shelves will look like they‚Äôve been custom-fitted.
We go CRAZY for wicker baskets with fabric edges. In fact, we bought four in the time it took you to read this sentence. But don‚Äôt worry, our credit card‚Äôs safe. Plenty of chic options can be found in affordable places like IKEA. Try to steer clear of plastic, though. It can turn yellow over time.
Step 3. Declutter
Declutter. And the more radical you are with it, the better. Just like when you go to the hairdressers for a trim and come home with half your hair missing, it‚Äôs better to do a major refresh than none at all.
Play a little game of stash or trash. Anything you haven‚Äôt used in the last five years should go. Old sheets and towels can be donated while expired toiletries need to say hello to the bin.
We‚Äôre not ones to curb back anyone‚Äôs shopping habits (hides online search history), but keeping a stripped-back, streamlined set of items in our closets makes everything simpler.
As a general rule, try to stick to two bed sheets and pillow covers per bed.
The two rule also applies to towels. Two bath towels and two hand towels per person are a good general rule to stick to.
Step 4. Make everyday essentials easy to access
Dinner‚Äôs our shout if you just follow this killer tip that will cut your day-to-day stress levels way down. Keep your favourites upfront.
The space between your waist and eye level is the easiest to reach, so store everyday essentials there. Keep bulkier items on the lower shelves or on the floor. Items you rarely use should be stored out of the way on the top shelves.
Step 5. Group like items together
Show us a map, and we‚Äôll instantly list off the Greek islands on our holiday wish list. But organizing a linen closet doesn‚Äôt come so naturally. To keep it simple, arrange items in groups. Make a dedicated section for towels, a separate shelf for bed sheets and so on. As a bonus, it‚Äôll make looking for something simple.
Step 6. Organize items seasonally
Picture unexpected guests coming to stay. You‚Äôve freshly made their beds, towels are ready in the bathroom, and you‚Äôve even got enough time to make yourself a spicy beverage. Of course, the sun‚Äôs shining and the birds are chirping because this is a fantasy. Yet sticking to a quick linen closet clean-up twice a year could make this a reality.
Think about those items that you only use a few times a year. They‚Äôre taking up precious real estate in your closet. Things like Christmas tablecloths and beach towels should be packed away until needed. Store warm blankets upfront for the winter and make lighter linens easily accessible during the summer months.
***These tips also translate well to organizing your linen clothing. ***
Top Tips: How To Organize A Linen Closet
- Roll, don‚Äôt fold ‚Äî when it comes to space-saving tips, this one beats them all. Roll up your towels instead of folding them, and you‚Äôll be able to fit more towels in the same spot. Plus, it keeps towels free of any wrinkles. For those ready to go above and beyond, follow queen Marie Kondo‚Äôs steps on how to roll and fold.
- Keep enough buffer room ‚Äî try not to fill up shelves and containers to the max. It‚Äôs always good to have a little extra breathing space for any unexpected items.
- Woven baskets ‚Äî we love an item that can be both stylish and functional, and that‚Äôs a woven basket. You‚Äôll love walking into your closet when it‚Äôs filled with these, and they make everything look tidy.
- Keep it beautiful ‚Äî organized doesn‚Äôt have to mean boring or sterile. Decorate your linen closet with pots, flowers and framed pictures. Pretty plates or bowls add personality but can also be used to display bits and pieces in a neat way.
- Add scents ‚Äî scented wax tablets or pouches of dried lavender add a sense of luxury to your linen closet, and they come without the price tag. It‚Äôs all about making it a place that‚Äôs as welcoming and pleasant as possible.
How To Store Bedroom Linens For Maximum Longevity?
We‚Äôll jump into bed well before bedtime when a freshly cleaned set of sheets and covers is waiting. Plus, our bedroom linens usually get softer and more comfortable as time passes, so it‚Äôs important to care for them correctly.
Keep linens in fabric bags to stop dust from collecting on the surface. Don‚Äôt forget to routinely wash the fabric bags as well as the linens to keep everything as fresh and clean as possible.
For extra points, place acid-free paper between each sheet to create more air circulation and guarantee that your sheets will stay cleaner for longer.
Or you can even store bed sheets within a matching pillowcase. It means sheets will still be protected, and you‚Äôll also have all the bedding together in one place ‚Äî no more mix-ups when you need to make a fresh bed. For more organization tricks on how to store bedroom linens, click here.
How To Store Pillows Correctly
Pillow addicts, you can never have too many pillows, can you? Help is on the way with our tip that will help you keep adding to your collection without having your whole home drown in pillows.
Stick to a few high-quality inserts in standard sizes ‚Äì a good percentage of down and feathers ‚Äî and then go wild with the covers. Covers save space while still giving you a chance to put your personality and style ideas on full display.
When storing your pillow inserts ‚Äî the soft cushiony part ‚Äî the key is to space them evenly so they don‚Äôt get cramped and lose shape.
We highly recommend arranging them on shelves with plenty of breathing room.
What To Do If You Have A Small Linen Closet?
Sparkly diamonds come in teeny, tiny boxes. Just proving the point that small doesn‚Äôt always equal bad.
If you have a small linen closet, not to worry. Look for areas around the rest of your home where there‚Äôs some extra space. Thinking creatively might even land you bonus design points in the end. A wooden chest of drawers at the end of the bed or ottomans with hidden inside shelving are all winning options.
Some other ideas:
- trunks made from wicker ‚Äì infuse timeless charm into any room.
- buffet cabinets with closed doors ‚Äî for dining room linens
- shelving underneath coffee tables ‚Äì for your most special and beautiful tablecloths.
- beds with built-in storage drawers underneath ‚Äî design and function points.
- while they might not look the best, vacuum-sealed bags are huge space-savers.

Discover how to shrink linen at home for best results that won't cause any headaches.
You can't expect us to show up at every pilates class, even if we said we would. But you can expect us to dish out all we know about linen.
For those rare few times when you actually want to shrink your linen pieces, we're here to help. Firstly, yes, it can be done ‚Äî from home and without going out and buying any special tools or detergents. You can still go out shopping for other things, though.
Secondly, it's important to know in what situations you would use these shrinking methods. We'd say it's appropriate to try to shrink linen clothing when they're cut in an oversized, loose fit and you're hoping for something more fitted. Or, as the designers would say, a figure-skimming silhouette.
If you're trying to jump a few sizes, it's best to get it tailored or phone in help from the professionals.
Learn the exact method (dare we say science) of how to shrink linen below so expertly that you'll be highly impressed with yourself and love the results. Don‚Äôt worry; your favourite linen midi dress is in safe hands.
Does linen shrink when washed?
Linen can only shrink in the wash at high temperatures. So keep eating while wearing white-on-white linen with full confidence ‚Äî your washing machine will save the day.
A maximum of 4% shrinkage can happen after the first wash with linen. But most quality linens have been pre-washed, so you don't have to worry about this happening. Check the garment label. It should say ""pre-washed"".
It's recommended to wash linen at 30C on a short cycle for perfect results every time. Check out all the details on how to wash linen correctly.
Do different fabrics shrink differently?
Some fabrics shrink more easily than others. So before you start any type of shrinking, always check the garment label and find out what material your clothing is made from and what's the percentage.
Pure cotton and wool are the easiest materials to shrink. While synthetic fibres aren't and keep their shape. Silk is a notoriously delicate fabric, and it's not recommended to try any DIY shrinking on it. The excessive heat could damage the fabric forever.
Linen is somewhere in between. If you want to purposely shrink your linen clothing, you can ‚Äì from home and with little effort.
Does linen shrink in the washer or dryer?
Linen can shrink in both the washer and dryer, so take extra care. It's all about the heat. High temperatures are what can make linen shrink. So stay away from high dryer heat (over 35C) and hot water washing machine cycles (over 30C) to keep your linens in top condition for years and years.
3 Methods to shrink linen
1. Get it tailored
Getting your linens tailored is the most precise way to shrink them. You'll be able to control exactly how much smaller your clothing will become. Obviously, if you have linen pants that need to be shortened, getting them hemmed is the way to go. But even if you're hoping for a more cinched-in waist, an experienced seamstress will be able to make it happen.
2. By hand
This method is the most gentle. So use it on all the pieces that you love and treasure. Delicate linen tops and dresses are best shrunk with this method. Soak your linens in warm water. But make sure it's not boiling hot. Next, leave your linen in the water for roughly 10 hours. Stir every so often. This method allows you to check up regularly on your linen and see how it is progressing. Then, air dry the linen.
3. Using the washing machine & dryer
Caution. This method comes with a warning written in big red letters. Only use this method if you've tried shrinking by hand and it didn't work.
Don't exaggerate too much when trying to shrink your linens in the washing machine and dryer. A small increase in temperature can create plenty of shrinkage. Start a washing cycle on warm heat (40-50C)and put your linen shirt into the machine. Close the washing machine door. (the reminder is for us; you probably don't need it).
Finish off in the dryer at a low heat setting. Somewhere around 30C would be a good start. The higher the heat and the longer the time, the more shrinking. We recommend gradually working your way to your preferred size and fit so there aren't any surprises.
How many sizes will linen shrink?
While we can predict that another mega-celebrity will come out with a skincare line by the end of the year (huge eye roll), we can't predict with complete accuracy how much your linen clothing will shrink.
But you can expect about 2-3% shrinkage if you use one of the methods above. It will vary depending on the brand, thickness of fabric and the type of garment. If you're hoping to shrink your clothing a lot, it's best to call in the professionals. You'll get the best results with tailoring.
Steps: How to shrink linen
Before you run to the laundry room, please read these steps on how to shrink linen.
- Check the garment tag
It's important to know what material you're working with. Is your piece of clothing 100% linen or a blend? If it's a linen-cotton blend, it will likely shrink less easily. So keep that in mind.
- Think through your options
Can your linen dress be tailored? Going the washing machine route should be more used as a last resort.
- Shrink your linen by hand
Shrinking by hand is the first and most gentle method. If your garment hasn't shrunk enough, then turn to your washing machine & dryer for help.
- Shrink your linen with the washing machine
Turn up the heat and shrink your linen on a warm water washing cycle. Then, throw it in the dryer. For results that aren't too extreme, we recommend sticking to 40-50C. Trying this method at higher temperatures could lead to clothing made for the children's section.
Top Tips: How to shrink linen
There are some linen pieces that we can't imagine ever having to part with. They're our go-tos for client meetings, big family gatherings or whenever we need to feel confident. That's why we've shared these tips so that there aren't any sad goodbyes.
- Be cautious. It's so hard to go back once your linen has shrunk. So, it's better to shrink gradually rather than do it all at once and be left with irreversible damage. For your first attempt, keep the temperature at around 40C and see what happens.
- Check the temperature & time. What will cause your favourite white linen shirt to shrink? High heat and how long it spends in water. To avoid dramatic shrinkages, increase the heat slightly and stick to a short wash cycle and a short time in the dryer.
Frequently Asked Questions
Will linen shrink permanently?
Linen's committed wholeheartedly to a makeover ‚Äî once you've shrunk her, she can't go back. So really make sure you're all in because results are really, really (x100) difficult to reverse. Plus, if you're going to have any regrets this year, why make it your linen?
Does linen shrink every time you wash it?

Will linen shrink by width or length?

Most definitely yes. With a few simple styling tips we‚Äôll show you how to wear linen in winter. It works very well. And in case you're still hesitant, here are a few more reasons to give wearing
linen in winter ""a go"".
Positives To Wearing Linen In Winter
Linen is a special type of natural fibre that keeps the wearer both warm and
cool ‚Äî one of the few natural fibres with this property.
- a natural insulator, linen will retain your body's heat, keeping you warm.
- it can also release any excess humidity, unlike cashmere, cotton and wool, which provide warmth but can also make you sweat.
When you've invested in a linen piece, expertly crafted and made from natural fibres, the hope is that the money spent will lead to value and versatility. It's possible to wear linen all year round ‚Äî the key is in the styling. Especially in the types of winters that Australia encounters, this is easily achievable.
For those exuding bohemian spirit in their fashion style, parting with your favourite linen pieces during the winter months can be difficult. Though, with some simple alterations to your way of dressing, the laidback, effortless elegance that linen evokes can be carried through to your winter wardrobe.
As the dreariness of winter drags on, and the wishes for the warmth of the sun, not seen for so long, rises ‚Äî evoke summer vibes by going back to your trusted summer linens and dressing in them. Whilst outside, the day may be cloudy and gloomy, yet donning your favourite linen jumpsuit will instantly transport you back to the summertime.
Viewed predominantly as only suitable for the summer, hopefully, we've shown the multiple benefits of wearing linen in winter. To make it work for you, we'll share our simple styling advice.
Tips for Elegant Layering
Layering different pieces of clothing together is a tried and tested styling method to enhance the warmth of your outfits. However, to achieve a classic look that works seamlessly as a whole, there are a few tips to keep in mind.
Tonal layering is a simple way to ensure you always look elegant and fashionable. It's very on-trend, and there's no risk of appearing garish with clashing colours that don't combine harmoniously with each other.
Many runway looks at renowned Fashion Week shows all feature tonal layering in some form or another ‚Äî as it's super sleek and modern. For example, if you're hoping to wear a black linen short sleeve top in the winter, you can layer underneath it a fitted long sleeve shirt in a warm fabric and a similar tone, i.e. black or dark grey.
Try to keep to winter colours when layering different items with your linen pieces. It will help to make you look more authentic and winter-appropriate. For this, linens in jewel colours and earthy tones would work well.
Layering With Linen Tops
Typically, you'd wear a linen top simply as is, by itself. Yet, for the winter, it's time to combine it with a long-sleeved shirt to give you the warmth you need.
When layering with a linen top, try to choose pieces with contrasting necklines ‚Äî it provides a refreshing design element. e.g. a boatneck linen top combined with a turtleneck fine wool top underneath.
Don't be afraid to mix different textures and fabrics in the same outfit. It will keep you looking compelling and adds depth.
If you‚Äôre layering an item underneath your linen top, ensure that the top is fitted and in the bodycon style for a flawless look.
The best shape to consider for linen tops is a loose-fitting silhouette. The greater the contrast between the fit of the two different tops, the greater the style. Our Relaxed Pallocino Top or Hecate Kimono Top would be superb linen to try this technique with ‚Äî as their oversized shape and kimono sleeves lend themselves perfectly to be layered over the top of a long-sleeved cotton shirt.
Another method for wearing linen in winter is to choose long sleeve tops. Perhaps, you even own some thicker, heavier linens which would suit well for the winter. Pair this with jeans, tucked in with a belt or worn loosely. And voil√†, you have yourself a fine looking winter outfit.
Think along the lines of our Gaia Tunic. Or our Ragazzo Shirt with a simple cami underneath and a pair of high-waisted jeans ‚Äî splendid.
A versatile closet staple for the winter that most of us have is a long woollen cardigan. Instead of trying to run away from the cold, embrace the cosiness aspect that the winter months bring ‚Äî and cocoon yourself in the warm embrace of wool.
Pair the cardigan with a fitted linen top or a super elegant cami, like our Tie Knot Cami Top. To boost the warmth factor, opt for a longer length cardigan whose hemline trails past the hips.
Wearing Linen Dresses In Winter
Linen dresses are an effortless way to attain elegance. The tailoring and cut of the linen fall beautifully on the body ‚Äî making it suitable for all different silhouettes & sizes. As an added bonus, easily transition from a day doing errands at the farmer's market to a fancy dinner with the ladies.
So why leave such a classy, versatile item locked up in your closet during the winter? Instead, take that pretty linen dress out for a spin. And we'll show you how.
To be a little chic and a little edgy, all at the same time, try wearing a linen dress over a fitted top. Very 90s. And adding some nostalgia is always a fun!
For those chilly days, slip on a linen dress over a pair of warm leggings or tights. You'll be simultaneously comfortable and fashionable. An outfit like this works incredibly well with tunic-style dresses, like our Calliope Tunic.
Why not combine a classic double-breasted wool coat with a linen dress? You'd never think twice about combining such a coat with a cotton, silk or wool dress ‚Äî and it works just as well with linen. Remember:
- the longer the hemline, the warmer you'll be
- for a more formal look, combine the coat with a more structured grand style of linen
Our Safari Wrap Dress, Rhodes Layered Dress or Hera Drawstring Dress would be perfect additions. To be particularly daring and extravagant, you could pair them with a magnificent shearling or faux wool coat. The contrast in textures and styles will add glamour.
To dress up your linens, select pieces made from premium quality natural fibres of a very fine variety. The finer your linen, the more it will almost glisten like silk and look incredibly classy.
Wearing Linen Pants In Winter
A beloved linen pant is a wardrobe must. Offering the ultimate in comfort with a flattering silhouette ‚Äî it's almost unrivalled! And you definitely don't need to part with your favourite pair during the wintertime. Here are a few styling tips that will help make the transition smooth.
Enhance the warmth factor by styling winter accessories with your linen trouser. These could include:
- knee-high socks & tights (to be worn underneath) or
- an ankle boot worn with a cuffed linen
Tights under pants can sometimes be uncomfortable, with them constantly needing to be pulled up, yet knee-high socks made from wool are a good compromise.
Layering with warm pieces on your top half can also be a good strategy. Pair a linen trouser with a chunky woollen jumper of your choice ‚Äî and you're ready for the winter deluge. A solid casual combination is a white woollen sweater with a khaki green coloured wide leg linen pant.
If that's not enough layers, let's up the stakes. With the addition of a jean jacket over the woollen jumper. Or even a parka.
Choose a pant that gives you the best of both worlds. That would be linen blended with another textile, like a cotton or a cashmere. You'll be gifted with extra warmth. A perfect linen pant to wear for winter is our Piega Trouser, a classically tailored 50% linen and 50% cotton blend.
Recap: How To Wear Linen In Winter
For anyone time-poor, here's a short recap of how to wear linen in winter ‚Äî with a few simple tips. The quickest answer is layering. Layer, layer and then layer some more until the desired warmth effect is achieved.
When layering with linen remember to:
- keep the outfit more or less in the same tone ‚Äî it creates an elegant, coherent look
- wear leggings or tights with linen dresses ‚Äî always an easy way to
- incorporate the fabric into your winter style
- if layering shirts, turtleneck sweaters underneath a linen piece, ensure it's tightly fitted
- pair your linen trouser with winter accessories (knee-high socks, ankle boots)

Before any washing takes place, it‚Äôs a good idea to decide whether you‚Äôll use the washing machine or wash by hand. Linen is a woven textile with some pieces more delicate than others. If your linen clothing features a very loose weave with lots of breathability and transparency, it‚Äôs best to opt for handwashing. For any other linens, machine washing is convenient and won‚Äôt cause any damage.

Introducing our favourite midi linen dresses for women and how to rock them.
How fast has summer whizzed by? One minute we were lounging by the pool, sipping on iced almond lattes. We were traipsing around all carefree in slip dresses, oversized shirts and kaftans, making peace with our awkward tan lines.
Then the next minute, autumn rudely marched in and demanded we refresh our wardrobes. And stop going on holidays (the cheek).
Now we‚Äôre stuck somewhere in between, not hot or cold. The dreaded limbo zone where you‚Äôre wondering if you should suck it up and go to early morning pilates or hit snooze. For the record, we vote snooze.
You walk into your closet, but everything looks dull. Not to mention that it‚Äôs tricky to put together the right outfit when the sun‚Äôs still out, but the afternoon breeze brings the temps down.
That‚Äôs when a fabulous dress walks into the room to solve your problems. As much as one piece of clothing can. Mondays will still be hard, but at least you‚Äôll look classy.
Who‚Äôs the superstar? A linen midi dress, classic and versatile. How are we always behind on our to-do lists or in a rush? This sophisticated number makes being on the move an easy, sweat-free affair. We speak from personal experience.
If you‚Äôre sending a message to the group chat saying, ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt make it‚Äù, because you‚Äôve got nothing fab to wear, this one‚Äôs for you, darling. Plus, we‚Äôre already running a bath, jump in and let‚Äôs get ready. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll be home by 9.
What‚Äôs The Most Flattering Midi Dress?
The midi dress finishes below the knees and above the ankles so that you can show off your cute shoes. Hello, brand new leather slides.
Can a midi make you look shorter and frumpier? It's a begrudging yes, from us. But can this be prevented? Absolutely.
For a flattering fit all round that makes you look in the mirror and not want to run, pay close attention to the cut of the midi dress. Just like a yoga class that's not too short or too long, the length of the midi dress should be just right.
If you spot a midi that finishes at the middle of the calf ‚Äî usually the widest section of our legs ‚Äî pretend to talk on your phone and cross the street. Then go higher or lower with the hemline.
Going with a lightweight fabric, like linen or cotton and choosing more structured designs will also help create a sleek and modern look.
What To Look For In Your Midi Dress?
The whole less-is-more aesthetic is easy when you nail the design of your midi dress. With little need for accessories, you'll be getting ready faster than it takes you to reschedule a Friday afternoon meeting.
Here are the features to look for to find the best midi linen dresses for women:
- Lightweight fabrics
- Neutral colours & patterns
- At least one tailored detail in your dress
Lightweight Fabrics
The good news is not all midi dresses are created equal. The bad news is, insert the previous sentence. If you're trying to steer clear of the frumpy look, then lightweight fabrics are a must.
Linen will create a clean, breezy style that says sophisticated and svelte. Plus, it's naturally breathable, hypoallergenic and free of nasty chemicals. A linen midi dress is a winner because of this, but ‚Äî we're also a little biased.
Stick With Solid Neutrals
Everyone loves a quick fix, and the quickest way to infuse your midi dresses with timeless appeal is to go for neutral tones. Think earthy khakis, crisp whites, cool greys and deep navy blues.
They're like the peacemakers of the colour world. So calm, you come to them with your problems, and they fit in with all your friend groups. You can always style a neutral dress with a vibrant-coloured bag for extra style points.
Make The Patterns Subtle
Good news for all print lovers, you don't have to ditch stripes just because you're hoping to look suave and stylish. You can always go for midi dresses dyed with subtle patterns.
For something different, you could opt for a neutral-coloured midi dress and layer underneath a printed shirt for a pop of colour and fun. Be a total pro, and choose a print that includes the neutral tone of the dress for consistency. Try to keep the midi sleek to make the layering seamless, and go for a collared shirt so it works with the neckline of the dress.
Say yes to very faint pinstripes and classic polka dots. These will still give you a print fix without making your outfits look overly busy or overwhelming. Not to make it all about us, but look below for our take on a subdued linen midi dress that's a stunner.
Tailored Is Best
We'll write love notes to loose-fitting linen dresses forever, but there's comfortable, and then there are sweats. Find a middle ground with a structured linen midi.
The trick is to opt for at least one tailored element in your dresses to keep comfort and fashion levels sky-high. Go for wrap or belted designs to contour the waist. Sleeveless options to show off your arms. Or unique necklines.
Tonal Styling
Much like smashed avocado salads, the perfect coffee order and online shopping, tonal styling is subtle but a total game-changer. It's a guaranteed way to look polished and put together with 0% stress.
Try to match your tones around your linen midi dress. If you're donning a cream-coloured midi, then opt for white-toned shoes and a bag. Instant chic, now if only putting together furniture was that easy.
How To Wear Midi Linen Dresses ‚Äì For Sparkle & Romance
When it comes to versatility, look no further than linen midis. We'll even prove it by styling them for various occasions.
Our Farfalla Linen Midi Dress is all things simple and elegant. Made from zero-waste fabric with 400% less water than cotton, it can do both beauty and heart. Pair it with flats for a casual day look or leather mules for work.
To make it sparkle, add some accessories, then book dinner reservations. Think a silk scarf tied around the neck or statement gold earrings to make you party-ready. Top it off with thin strappy heels to keep the look balanced but still glam.
How To Wear Midi Linen Dresses ‚Äì For The Everyday
Ready for an effortlessly elegant everyday look? Our Safari Wrap Linen Dress can do it all. Simply pair it with your favourite slides, and you're off.
Can't you imagine running errands or going to lunch with this pared-back number? We're obsessed. The wrap design nips in the waist but still keeps everything lightweight.
Breeze through the seasons with midi linen dresses for women. For a killer outfit, layer yours with linen tops in the same colour. Or, for extra warmth, pair our beige midi with a beige-coloured, thinly knitted sweater over the top.
How To Wear Midi Linen Dresses ‚Äì For Casual
The sun's shining brighter, and all your appointments have been cancelled for the day. Suddenly all your stress is gone with one magical dress.
Our Sirene Linen Midi Dress is a showstopper. Its balloon sleeves and tiered layers of flowing linen radiate easy feminine energy. Balance out the prettiness with sleek white sneakers, and you've got the perfect casual outfit.
When we show you how versatile this midi is, you'll realise it's a total keeper. Yes, it can be casual, but it can also go glam.
Need some inspiration? Try to style it with major sparkly jewels and eye-catching strappy heels ‚Äî wow. Or opt for chunky platform sandals and dance the night away without ever taking them off.
For the cooler weather, this airy dress is just waiting to be paired with knee-high boots. In case of an unexpected girls' catch-up, whip out this fashionable pairing.
Conclusion: How To Wear Midi Linen Dresses
Picture your dream day. Is it somewhere warm by the coast? On the Mediterranean? We're right there with you in the fantasy, along with your friends and family. But guess who else is coming along? Something that will make everyone think that you're a local. It has to be a midi linen dress. Classic and versatile, it deserves its own seat on the plane.

Wo[men] in LUXMII
This month we‚Äôre excited to introduce you to Pepe Arcos. He's a multi-talented creative with an inspiring resume.
A former national champion in freediving, he‚Äôs now an underwater fashion photographer and award-winning filmmaker.
Pepe Arcos | Underwater camera gear set up for a shoot | Lanzarote Island, Spain
His work is utterly unique, and whilst he‚Äôs not a LUXMII woman, we‚Äôd love to make him an honorary member.
He‚Äôs also the man behind the lens of the LUXMII lookbook campaigns, so he knows his fashion.
Luxmii Campaign | Athena Top | Location: Taipei, Taiwan
Pepe Arcos dives deep into the ocean with his camera where few have gone, capturing the secrets & wonders of life under the water.
His work requires him to hold his breath underwater for many minutes at a time to capture the perfect image.
Yet his photographs give no glimpse of the strenuous behind-the-scenes. Instead, they are poetic, spontaneous and emotive pieces of fine art.
To fall in love with his work (as we have!) check out his Instagram @pepearcos
Let‚Äôs explore his rare & exciting world further‚Ä¶

The ocean seems integral to your work. Where does your love for the ocean come from?

How did you start freediving?
Probably when I was 8 years old without me knowing that I was freediving. I remember my friend's parents took us snorkelling in Tarragona, Spain, and I could easily reach the sandy bottom and stay there for a little while.
The calm feeling of freedom and silence, plus being fully submerged in nature, kicked off a big passion.
Many years later, after starting scuba diving, I found out freediving was a sport and decided to take a course.
That changed my life completely. I became the Spanish National Champion and ranked 6th in the world for a couple of years.
Japanese athlete competing in the Depth Championship | Location: Sabang, Sumatra
Even the thought of freediving is terrifying to most people ‚Äî how do you conquer fear?
Freediving is all about relaxation and deep focus, some describe it as a meditation, but there is no room for fear in this sport.
Once you understand that the only thing that can stop you is your mind then you address those fears and learn how to switch off that part of your brain to fully release and let yourself flow deep into the ocean.

How do you inspire yourself creatively?
I guess my main mojo is to be a DOER. Creativity comes from working, not waiting.
It's a process of observation and execution, so it involves getting yourself into doing many things, one idea leads to another, and like this, a project can bloom.

You‚Äôre the photographer of the LUXMII lookbooks ‚Äî what do you love about LUXMII?
LUXMII's timeless concept of fashion. The unique, elegant & feminine minimalism of the collections with that boho touch.

You‚Äôre an extreme sportsman, yet you're photographs exude an ethereal calm. Do you do anything special to keep peace & calm in your life?
I believe it is not about me being calm but the subject itself. Wallace J.Nichols wrote in his book Blue Mind that ""being near, in, on, or underwater can make you happier, healthier, more connected, and better at what you do.""
I guess my main effort is to try to capture those moments of peace and flow that happen in front of my lenses.

How does your LUXMII linen fit into your life, working and days off?
LUXMII is simplicity at its very best. I layer it in the winter, and it's the easiest thing to throw on whilst exploring in the warmer weather.

On the hunt for an all-expenses paid trip to the Mediterranean? Sorry for getting your hopes up, but we‚Äôve got the next best thing. Breezy linen dresses that‚Äôll make you feel like you‚Äôre always on holiday.
Whether you‚Äôre planning to skip winter this year and head overseas for a much-deserved vacation Œør you‚Äôre incredibly organized and already getting ready for next summer (wow, we applaud you). These are the stunners you‚Äôll want to tell only your best girlfriends about.
Plus, read on for our tips on how to find the perfect linen beach dresses for you. And advice on how to style your favourites so that you‚Äôll be posting photos onto the ‚Äògram with full confidence.
What To Look For In Your Linen Beach Dresses
Just like the perfect allusive coffee, that‚Äôs hard to come by, the perfect linen dress isn‚Äôt always easy to find. It should tick off a few essentials. Here are the keys to finding your new favourites (because you‚Äôll want more than one):
- Fit
- Quality
- Thickness
Focus On The Fit
Gone are the days of shapeless linens. More flattering looks feature belts or seams in just the right places for a touch of tailoring. A linen wrap dress will make you love the way you look, and click ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù in seconds.
Linen still keeps all its breathability, lightness and wearability. But tailored details make it more modern and help enhance the beauty of the body. When scrolling endlessly online for the newest addition to your wardrobe, try to pay extra attention to the fit. It‚Äôll make a major difference.
Top-Quality Is Key
Once you fall in love with a linen dress, you‚Äôll want to wear it again and again. So that eventually means getting the washing machine involved. To keep your linens in their sparkly original condition after washes, it has to be a top-quality fabric.
For a linen dress that keeps getting more breathable as the temps rise, again, opt for quality. The lovely fresh feeling of linen on the skin is why we all fell in love, and certified organic linen will deliver this crispness and more.
Not to be that friend that turns every conversation topic into a chance to talk about themselves. But our LUXMII linen dresses are sustainable, organic and look like a million dollars.
Thickness Of The Fabric
Linen dresses can be light and airy or made from midweight and heavyweight fabrics that are thicker. Try to think about where and when you‚Äôll be wearing your linens to choose the right thickness for you.
Super-light linens can appear sheer once worn on the body. A little translucency might be a good thing for a beach cover-up, but maybe not so much for brunch‚Äîjust something to keep in mind.
Why Does Linen Make The Perfect Beach Dress?
- breathable ‚Äì everyone wants airy and breezy dresses on hot days, and linen doesn't disappoint. It's so naturally breathable you'll feel like you're in a fully air-conditioned room. Ok, so that's hyperbole, but it's definitely the most breathable fabric ever invented.
- washing linen is stress-free ‚Äì during the summer, we're all washing our clothes non-stop. Thankfully linen machine washes easily. Just stick to temperatures below 30C. Giving you extra peace of mind and time.
- healthy and clean for the skin ‚Äî linen loves your skin as much as you do. It's super gentle. Naturally anti-microbial and hypoallergenic, wearing linen means you won't be walking around with bacteria trapped in your clothes.
The Linen Beach Dresses That Are A Total Dream
Basique Linen Slip Dress
Introducing your new summer lifesaver, the Basique Linen Slip Dress that will keep you looking elegant, even if you only spent 10 mins getting ready. As its name suggests, simply slip into this light and airy number, and you're ready to wow.
Sustainably dyed in white, black, khaki or light grey, styling it comes without the headache. Match it with any timeless accessories, like leather slides, raffia bags or even a chic pair of every day sneakers.
The spaghetti straps add to the weightless barely-there feeling of this slip dress. Throw over an unbuttoned shirt in the same colour for protection against harsh rays or when the afternoon breeze kicks in. Beach looks are sorted.
Fiume Linen Maxi Dress
Got sand in the drink you've been waiting for all week? Not to fret. Nothing will be able to ruin your mood when you look this fabulous. Our Fiume Linen Maxi Dress is a stunner that's all about easy wear but still delivers on the glamour.
Bright and bold, just like the sun itself, the Fiume will have you feeling like your most confident, shining self. Its free-flowing tiered design perfectly suits beach day vibes, especially if that includes strolling, caf√© hopping or alfresco lunches.
Style with strappy sandals like all the other fashion girls. Or dress it up with pearl jewellery and red-coloured heels for the after-party. All that's left is to hit up your favourite people, empty your camera roll and get ready to make lifelong memories.
Luciole Linen Midi Dress
What does a dress say about you? The Luciole Linen Midi Dress says sophisticated, European design only in the best fabrics. Just to prove it, the Luciole is cut from OEXO-TEX certified organic French linen that's breathable and anti-microbial‚Äîperfection on a sweltering day.
This must-have tackles the cut-out trend in an elegant and tasteful way that's appropriate for brunches, shopping in the city and even evenings out on the town. The unique sage green colourways style best with sunkissed skin or anything else already in your wardrobe (or piled up in the laundry).
Take this beauty for a spin to the lands where she originates and see her flourish in her natural environment. While you nibble on freshly made pastries just like the French.
Sirene Linen Midi Dress
No summer outfit is complete without a dainty white dress with soft ruffles. Think garden party.
The tiered layers of the Sirene Linen Midi Dress create a subtle pleating effect that's instantly effortless and classy. The balloon sleeves and v-neckline are finishing touches that add even more doses of elegance. Capped sleeves give extra sun protection and Grecian feelings.
While perhaps too luxe to wear to the beach, it's definitely a number that will stun on any rooftop or outdoor dinner party overlooking the ocean. As a bonus, the classic white colourway makes styling fuss-free.
Vida Linen Wrap Dress
Who knew a beach cover-up could be this stylish? Welcome to our new Vida Linen Wrap Dress that's crafted from 100% pure linen and is the true feeling of luxury.
Featuring elegant kimono sleeves, side slits for easy movement and a flattering wrap design, this is a dreamy dress you won't want to take off. An elevated and fresh spin on the classic white linen dress, it delivers goddess vibes without even trying.
Fancy evening soiree, anyone? Or a post-beach dinner. This dress calls for a trendy sculptural heeled sandal or your best dainty gold and silver jewellery. Or pair it with an equally elegant wide-brimmed hat for the ultimate poolside look‚Äîwe can't resist the versatility.
How To Style Linen Beach Dresses
- the task is simple, linen dresses look stunning with any kind of fuss-free, clean accessories. But to nail the beach look, you won't lose with a woven straw tote bag and matching sun hat.
- for shoes, tie-up espadrilles, leather slides or even Birkenstocks all work wonders.
- in the bag department, anything with raffia will help add to the summer vibes. Luckily, large-scale bags are back on trend, so totes are also an easy go-to.
Conclusion: Our Linen Beach Dresses Edit

The perfect dress for entertaining
As long as you're sparkling and put together, no one will know about the mayhem that happened in the kitchen just moments before. That's the power of linen dresses. Paired best with an icy cold drink and lots of loved ones.
(It has to be linen. Aussie Summer, need we say more.) And here's the perfect one. It can't help with the cleanup the next day, but otherwise, our LUXMII linen midi dress is a must for entertaining.
It's the way the dress skims the figure and feels light on the skin that sets it apart and makes it a favourite. Plus, its effortlessly elegant silhouette sets the tone for a relaxed, fuss-free festive season full of laughs.
Acclaimed interior designer Katie Sargeant has styled our LUXMII linen midi dress for Provincial Home Living. How beautiful does she look? Sadly, the wonderfully decorated home doesn't come included with the dress, that's all Katie.
The way Katie has styled and decorated her home for Xmas is so gorgeous and has inspired this blog and tips. We'd say it was a job well done if our home could look half as good as Katie's these holidays.
How to decorate for Christmas
Use natural decorations like the pros
Fake snow is out, and native Australian fauna and flora are in. Or so interior decorators, glossy mags and our in-the-know girlfriends tell us. It's lovely that we Aussies are finally embracing what makes our Xmas so special ‚Äî being outdoors in the good weather. We'll skip over the part about the flies coming out of nowhere when the seafood's ready to be served.
Easy, breezy coastal styles are where it's at. There's not a tinsel in sight but plenty of eucalyptus branches. You can use them alongside Australian wildflowers to elevate everything from table centrepieces to linen napkins and even for extra oomph on wrapped presents. The best part? If you don't have one, at least you'll be able to snag a few branches from one of your neighbours or friends.
Make the table sparkle
How does that famous quote go? There's no more space in our brains; it's already occupied with complex mathematical equations, like how many kgs of potatoes do we need to buy for 8 people?
Goes on Google and finds the quote. We eat first with our eyes. So make your table the most inviting, sparkling place in your home that guests won't be able to resist. It doesn't matter so much what decorations you decide to go with as long as you stay consistent. In other words, pick a theme and commit.
Whether you love a traditional look, white-on-white or plenty of colour, Vogue Living has some stunning ideas for decorating your table.
Focus on one colour
Investing in quality table linens in a neutral colour palette helps the wallet and the eyes. You'll be able to use them all year round, but they'll still wow for the silly season, with a few special extras. Luckily, white goes beautifully with green, red and gold.
Be inspired by Katie's fresh take on the classics. Choose only one of the festive colours, and make it the star of your whole operation. Then, use it as an accent throughout with ribbons, servingware and plates.
Katie went with a deep modern green that also matches the garlands and eucalyptus greenery, not to mention the Xmas tree. It all works together wonderfully and is contemporary but still feels traditional.
It's all in the details
Getting an A+ for decorating is all about the little touches. A handmade name card for everyone is cute and gives you plenty of hosting points. The kitchen also deserves some love during the holiday season. A simple wreath works wonders. Or try fresh garlands on mantelpieces and greens from the garden dotted around the home for a festive vibe.
Ice is practically gold during the Aussie summer. Give it a Christmasy twist by making festive ice cubes. These can be frozen a month in advance and are super fun.
Hosting Survival Tips
Get your table linens and plates ready early
No one wants any surprises come the big day, so it helps to unpack everything you'll need for the table earlier. Things like washing and ironing can be done a few weeks before and will make you feel more on top of things when you can finally tick them off. As a bonus, bringing out the plates and linens gets you in a festive mood. All that's left is to press play on the Christmas playlist. Read our tips on how to wash linen for perfect results every time.
Don't be afraid to delegate
It's the only way to survive. Loved ones will love to be part of the day and help out. Say yes when they ask to bring a casserole or crackers and dips. Don't feel the pressure to have to do it all yourself. You can make a designated drinks station with all the ingredients ready and leave it to the guests to play at bartending.
Prep as much as you can
Grazing boards are a miracle. They look absolutely fabulous and are low maintenance. All you need is some imagination. Grab a wooden chopping board, seasonal fruits, meats, nuts and a few delicious cheeses, and you're guaranteed to have happy guests. Or at least you'll be able to keep them occupied enough to finish cooking Christmas Day lunch. Then treat yourself after all that hard work with a navy linen dress that makes it all worth it.
When picking the menu, try to add as many foods as you can that can be prepped early. Things like cold salads, desserts and marinated meats can all be made the day before. Saving you more time for putting your feet up. You're supposed to be on holiday, after all.
Create new traditions
Traditions are a warm, comforting hug that reminds us; however life changes, some things still stay the same. If you're on the fence about bringing out Grandma's fine china, just do it. Even if it doesn't match with the d√©cor. It's fun to incorporate a new tradition each year, and it doesn't have to be anything extravagant. A signature drink or Secret Santa are simple enough but still festive.
Get everyone involved
This one's for the girlfriends' group chat. There's so much DIY decorating that can be done at home on a budget with some good company. How much funner would it be to decorate cookies with all your friends and their kids? Or host a garland-making afternoon. Where everyone gets to take home a decoration for their mantel.
Conclusion: How To Host A Holiday Party That's Unforgettable
The countdown to Christmas has officially begun. Make your holiday party one for the books with our top tips on how to host an unforgettable holiday party that will leave you with only happy memories.
Stick to a theme
There's no right or wrong when it comes to Xmas decorating. It's the one time you can go as gaudy and geeky as you like. But try to be consistent. Whether it's a colour, flower or cranberries that you want to focus on, incorporating them in small ways throughout your decorating will create a harmonious, gorgeous look.
Embrace the Aussie summer
The silly season seems to work better when we adapt it to our unique climate. We're blessed with fresh seasonal fruits and seafood that are light enough for the hot weather, so make them the feature rather than the heavier, more traditional Christmas food. But every family is different, so do what will make everyone the happiest.
Modern decorations
You can also leave the FOMO behind for the decorations. It's now trendy to celebrate Australian flowers and greenery rather than trying to recreate a winter wonderland in your home while everyone is melting under the hot sun.
Prepare your table early
Get your table linens, plates and placemats all out early to see what you're working with. Are there any plates or cutlery missing? Doing it early gives you enough time to shop for what you need or work out a solution. Make sure to wash linens a week before to save you time in the hectic lead-up to Christmas. Read our blog on how to iron linen for crisp results.

Turns out life really is on our side. Green juices and pumping iron are not the only ways to keep healthy.
Do not worry if you missed every Pilates class this week. According to personal experience and the experts (they wear white lab coats), wearing organic linen can be a big boost to your overall well-being.

The French Riviera is never far away when you are sporting an all-linen look. Wherever you may be or however behind you are on your laundry, linen ensures you always feel like your most confident self and gives you that post-holiday glow.
Why do linen tops feel so lovely and light on the skin? There is now evidence of linen‚Äôs countless healing properties. Science has finally caught up to our genius and discovered what we had known all along that linen is a fantastic natural fabric.
Read on below to discover the health benefits of linen that will leave you looking effortlessly elegant and healthy.
Linen Benefits
Free of harmful chemicals
The kinds of fabrics we choose to wear matter.
Go back in time (just a few years) to high school biology class, where we were all taught that the skin is our largest organ and is permeable. Whatever touches our skin for long periods of time will likely end up in our bodies.
No one would drink a bottle of poison willingly. So why is it acceptable to buy synthetic fabrics full of chemicals? These harmful ingredients will eventually wind up inside us, albeit at lower concentrations.
Our LUXMII linen is proudly OEKO-TEX¬Æ 100 certified, which is like the golden stamp of approval in the fabrics world. Basically, it means our linen pieces contain 0 nasties and 100% elegance. Our linen is rigorously tested to ensure that it does not contain any chemicals toxic to the human body.
What‚Äôs OEKO-TEX¬Æ 100? It‚Äôs an international and independent body that tests products at every stage of the production process. There are more than 100 harmful chemicals that are tested for, making this linen the only option for those with allergies, sensitive skin or anyone looking to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
Flax plants are very low maintenance and need hardly any water or fertilizers to grow well. This makes them more healthier than the majority of man-made textiles. But organic-certified linen goes one step further.
Discover more about what is flax linen in our blog.
Why are natural fabrics better for our health?
While pricier, natural fabrics are worth the investment, they‚Äôre much better for us. Think of it as paying a little extra for something that is priceless, our health.
The book Killer Clothes: How Seemingly Innocent Clothing Choices Endanger Your Health, is a must-read. It makes a compelling case for natural fabrics.
Synthetics have only been widely used for the last 60 years, coincidentally the time during which chronic diseases have skyrocketed.
The health issues synthetics could cause include dermatitis, hormonal, and respiratory issues. The US military even outlaws artificial fabrics. They are classed as a severe fire hazard and aren‚Äôt allowed to be worn off base.
No one can be perfect, but it does help to limit the chemicals we use in our lives. These include cleaning supplies, cosmetics, food and the clothing we wear. While we are healthy, these everyday items may not pose such a big risk, but if we get sick, then they can make a significant difference.
Linen‚Äôs long medical history
Flax has been used as a bandage for thousands of years, at least since Ancient Greece, where it was talked about in Homer‚Äôs Illiad. The Ancient Egyptians recommended a remedy of linen, honey and oil in their medical manuals for almost all soft tissue injuries.
There‚Äôs a recent trend towards using more natural materials in medicine, so new studies have been done on linen‚Äôs healing properties. Flax is known to help repair DNA damage, with wounds bandaged with flax showing decreased levels of free radicals, AKA the bad guys.
Here‚Äôs an interesting fact you can bring up next time there‚Äôs a lull in the convo. Hospitals use bed sheets made from linen. Why linen? Because it‚Äôs known to promote recovery and fight infection.
Some days, bed looks like the place to be, and now there‚Äôs a perfectly valid excuse. It‚Äôs called healing. As long as your bed sheets & covers are made from the finest organic linen and freshly washed, sleeping on them is the ultimate act of self-care. Now, if only that could also somehow count as ‚Äòwork‚Äô.
More Benefits Of Linen
Body temperature regulating
Please bear with us as we get a little technical for just a second and talk about body temperature regulation, which is essential for good health.
Our ideal body temperature ranges between 36.5C and 37.5C. Now, that is not a lot of room for error. As soon as our temperature goes outside this range, essential metabolic and enzymatic processes can start to function poorly.
It is a beautiful, complex dance that happens within our bodies and can be quickly disputed because of overheating or cooling. Here is where linen comes in to save the day, as it naturally regulates body temperature.
This means when you are hot, linen keeps you feeling fresh, and when it is cold, linen helps warm up your skin. It is what makes linen sheets the perfect companion for bed.
Mood booster
Linen cannot help your overflowing email inbox, but it can at least make you feel more Zen.
The natural cooling properties of linen clothing and how effortlessly it allows air to circulate from your body through the fabric. It is why you will feel calm and peaceful wearing your favourite linen pants, even if you are behind on your to-do list.
Is linen good for the skin?
Linen feels delightful on the skin. But is that just our bias getting in the way of cold, hard facts? Apparently not. There is plenty of evidence that it is beneficial for the skin.
Breathable
Hot days ask for ultra-breathable linen. For surviving the summer, there‚Äôs nothing better than breezy linen dresses ‚Äî and icy drinks, in that order.
The fabric‚Äôs breathability is thanks to the natural characteristics of the flax plant. The plant features a woody stem that is hollow. This allows air and water to move freely, leaving your skin feeling fresh and cool.
Breathability is actually so important when it comes to caring for your skin. So look out for it if you suffer from allergies, psoriasis or sensitive skin.
Wearing constricting clothing can cause sweating and irritation, which then leads to flare-ups, and the vicious cycle begins again. What else can‚Äôt organic linen do? Other than pay taxes, almost everything.
Anti-microbial
We could write a whole album of tearjerking love songs about linen, and here‚Äôs yet another reason to fall in love. Linen is naturally anti-microbial, which makes it an absolute dream for your skin.
Clean freaks look away, this next bit is a horror story with scary main characters like bacteria, fungi and mould. Synthetic fabrics keep all these nasties trapped in the fabric, so much so that they do not even come out in the wash. But linen does not. It allows bacteria to escape through its loose weave, guaranteeing cleanliness.
Environmentally-friendly
Say hello to the Greta Thunberg of the fabric world. Linen is the most sustainable fabric by a long shot. When it is not too busy ridding the world of pesticides, it is hugging trees and making the modern woman look sophisticated.
Hoping to cut down on screen time? Yeah, it has not happened for us yet either, but let a woman dream. At least you can save water by choosing linen clothing. Linen needs a whopping 400% less water than cotton. Plus, it will also make you feel 400% more elegant. (That number may not be scientifically proven yet.)

Why we love linen and the benefits of wearing clothing made from this wonder fabric.
There was a time in history when linen clothes were reserved for high society and the noble ‚Äì linen was once so precious that it was even used for wrapping the bodies of mummies in Egypt, contributing to the preservation of such ancient treasures.
However the cultivation of flax spread throughout the 16th century and beyond, making linen more available.
Fast forward to today and linen is being rediscovered and redefined as a luxury fabric that is highly sustainable‚Ä¶ in fact linen is one of the few fabrics that is almost 100% biodegradable and requires very little water!
From high street brands to luxury designers and premium labels creating elegant yet functional pieces like our Milos Dress, it‚Äôs evident that linen is making a comeback with its ever-growing popularity and with the added benefits of being an ethically and sustainably produced material (a huge topic that‚Äôs here to stay‚Ä¶ hopefully) it‚Äôs no wonder linen has become a favourite, especially for those warmer months!
Many say linen is their preferred fabric for clothing of healing, healthy living and general well being but what exactly is linen and how is it beneficial?
What exactly is linen and how is it made?
Linen is a natural plant fibre that comes from the inner bark of flax stems, called the bast. To extract the bast, the plants are either cut or pulled from the ground, by hand. Some even say that by pulling, creates finer more delicate linen!
It is put through a process called retting which essentially removes the plant stock from the fibres. Once this happens, the fibres are then separated in order to collect the longest pieces, which are then spun into yarn, woven into linen fabric and made into bedding and linen clothing.
The flax plants we use are grown in Europe and require little to no pesticides, fertilisers or irrigation. It is then woven and made into beautiful linen garments like our beloved Pallocino Top, by family-run ateliers in Greece, Portugal and Hong Kong.
Our linen is also Oeko-Tex certified (standard 100), which simply means that no harsh chemicals were used therefore deemed safe for humans. Furthermore, we collaborate with family-run factories with above-standard working conditions that employ less-intensive chemical processes (such as the dye they use to colour the fabric) and share our vision for a more sustainable future in the textile and garment industry.
Now to the good stuff‚Ä¶
Here are 5 benefits of wearing linen and why we have fallen in love with this wonder fabric:
#1 It‚Äôs got some serious strength and durability
Linen is considered to be the strongest of all natural fibres. Being 30% stronger than any other natural fabric means that your linen pieces will last longer, making it a perfect addition to your collection of wardrobe essentials.
A high quality dress made of cotton could last you a few seasons but one made from linen will live far beyond that, making the cost-per-wear significantly decreases.
Moreover, your linen clothes won‚Äôt lose their shape after washing unlike other natural fabrics, if anything, they become softer and even more pleasant to the skin over time.
And since it‚Äôs a generational fabric, with proper care, you‚Äôll be able to pass down your favourite linen dresses like this one, for your granddaughters to enjoy for years to come. What an amazing benefit and reason to buy linen clothing, when they last more than a generation!
#2 It‚Äôs sustainable and almost fully biodegradable
As we‚Äôve mentioned, linen is made from the stalks of flax, which is an extremely resilient plant which has the ability to grow under poor conditions; little use of fertiliser and water making it one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly fabric out there!
In fact, and this is probably our favourite benefit to wearing linen clothing is that, when ecologically dyed meaning that no harsh chemicals are used in the colouring process, your linen clothes are fully biodegradable!
Did you also know that the flax seeds and oils serve as a source of nutrition for both animals and humans?! This amazing life cycle results in a zero-waste fabric that is both recyclable and renewable.
Another benefit of linen clothing is that it will degrade much faster than your cotton pieces.
More on sustainable fashion‚Ä¶.
Have you noticed the rising popularity of environmentally friendly and ethically made clothing? As an ethical brand, we are thrilled to see more and more people becoming aware of the damage that the textile industry is doing to our planet with the growing piles of waste and landfill it‚Äôs contributing to, so by opting for sustainable alternatives, is a great way to contribute to this positive movement!
And since the flax plant is very resilient, these little guys can grow under poor soil quality and require little to no irrigation or pesticides. With linen being inherently sustainable in nature, at Luxmii, we aim to ban all single-use plastic from all stages of our supply chain by 2021, with the aim to one day become zero-waste whilst still creating beautiful and wearable garments.
Now back to the benefits of wearing linen!
#3 Easy to care for and oh so versatile.
Since linen is an extremely durable fabric, it doesn‚Äôt require any special treatment. However there are a few notable things to remember when washing your linen in order to prolong its life ‚Äì here are our simple recommendations on how to care for your linen.
A great benefit about linen clothing is that although considered a luxury fabric, it is safe to machine wash, just bear in mind to use room temperature or cold water so as to avoid any shrinkage and avoid bleach or detergents with a whitening effect as these harsh chemicals tend to weaken the fibre.
Another benefit about linen clothing is that it doesn‚Äôt need to be ironed to look good. As one of the most wrinkle-prone fabrics out there, its creasy imperfections is what makes this wonder fabric so charming!
What‚Äôs more is that high quality linen is even more wrinkly as it is normally finer and dainty in nature. Have you noticed that effortless elegance achieved with a full linen look is rarely applied to any other fabric?!
Imagine yourself in an all-white linen outfit, sun-kissed skin and your favourite clutch, on your way to a beach-side bistro for the evening after a day out sailing! No other fabric could be more appropriate than linen to carry you from a day out and into the night.
With linen‚Äôs innate ability to compliment every occasion, it‚Äôs perfect to take with you on vacation. At Luxmii, we have thousands of career-driven powerfraus that have fallen in love with our designs as they have found them to be work appropriate yet comfortable to wear all day long.
Combining a versatile fabric such as linen with wearable yet unique styles, is what sets us apart. Each piece has been thoughtfully and consciously designed with the intention to easily mix and match with other pieces in your wardrobe hence the use of natural core colours and cuts.
Styling your linen look isn‚Äôt only limited to the warmer months. In fact, linen is becoming increasingly popular in the fall and winter too! Why? Because linen is one of the very few if not only natural fabric that can keep you both cool and warm.
The pros of wearing linen when it‚Äôs warm is endless; lightweight, breathable and moisture-wicking being at the top of the list but linen is actually also a natural insulator and has the ability to release excess humidity so whilst wool, cashmere or cotton might make you feel warm at first, it will also make you sweat.
Linen on the contrary will retain the heat from your body and whatever excess is leftover which keeps you warm and dry. During winter we suggest layering up, by using your linen clothes as a base layer or your skin‚Äôs first point of contact.
This way your body can benefit it‚Äôs natural insulating properties. And who doesn‚Äôt love a layered look! Creating stylish outfits so you can continue wearing your favourite linen pieces year long sounds like a great way to keep your linen outfit game strong even during the colder months!
An amazing benefit to wearing linen is that you‚Äôre likely to sweat twice as less wearing linen clothing, than any other fabric.
#4 It has healing properties and health benefits
Linen is breathable and highly absorbent, this means that when you sweat, linen will take the perspiration away from your skin to prevent that sticky and uncomfortable clammy feeling and keep you dry as it‚Äôs moisture wicking so wearing linen actually cools you down and in turn you sweat less.
Furthermore, another amazing benefit to wearing linen is that you‚Äôre likely to sweat twice as less wearing linen clothing, than any other fabric!
Another benefit of wearing linen clothes is that it‚Äôs hypoallergenic meaning that it suppresses bacteria, fungi, and pollen. In fact, linen helps prevent many allergic disorders and even aids in improving skin conditions like eczema and chronic rashes as there is a much less likely chance for bacteria and microbes to breed.
And since body odour is caused by bacteria, wearing a linen shirt on a humid or hot day will keep you staying fresher for longer, not to mention the fact that your clothes will harbour less germs due to its hypoallergenic properties.
#5 It‚Äôs so luxurious and elegant yet comfortable to wear everyday
If you‚Äôve read all the above benefits of linen clothing, you probably already got the idea that linen, being lightweight, breathable, moisture-wicking, and thermoregulating, is at the top of the pyramid of comfortable clothing. But we‚Äôd also like to add that linen clothes are usually designed to have a relaxed-fit making them perfect for people of all ages, sizes, and shapes.
So go on, find a piece of linen clothing that will change your life. We‚Äôre serious ‚Äî it can really do that!
Final thoughts
With all it‚Äôs amazing qualities, we hope that we have shared some insight into all the incredible benefits of wearing linen clothing. Linen currently makes up for only a mere 1% of the world‚Äôs textile and apparel production mainly due to the considerable time and effort it takes to produce linen yarn, making it a high priced luxury fabric.
To recap all of the benefits that linen clothing brings, we can refine it down to a simple 5 point list:
- It‚Äôs strong and durable
- It‚Äôs sustainable and biodegradable
- It‚Äôs easy to care for and versatile
- It has healing properties and various health benefits
- It‚Äôs luxurious and elegant yet comfortable for everyday wear
If you‚Äôve ever asked people who wear linen, they‚Äôre likely to tell you that they can‚Äôt imagine life without it. We‚Äôd have to say that we feel the exact same way. How do you feel about linen clothing?

Love the breathability and lightness of linen? And also wish for the smooth crispness of a perfectly ironed shirt? You can have it both.
Let‚Äôs explore a few simple tips and tricks on how to iron your linen clothing. It‚Äôs simple, we promise.
Yes, linen is known for its unique texture and relaxed, rumpled look. Why? It‚Äôs a premium natural fabric crafted from flax plants fibres.
These have very little elasticity, which means that if wrinkles or creases form, the fabric doesn't easily spring back into its original shape.
Yet, it's all part of the effortless, lived-in charms of linen that we all love.
For those that long for a smoother, crisper finish, it does mean you'll need to bring out the iron.
Luckily, ironing linen is not too complicated, and as long as you follow some super-easy basics, you'll be amazed at the results.
What You Need For Ironing Linen
Luckily, it's not too complicated when it comes to linen. The tools you'll need are most likely things you've already got at home.
- Spray Bottle ‚Äî fill any spray bottle with clean water and use it to spritz and lightly dampen your linen before ironing. It will make smoothing out any creases much more painless.
- Steam Iron ‚Äî it's vital to have a top-quality iron, not just for linen but any fabric. The key to success when ironing linen is to both have high heat and a good deal of steam. An added bonus is a spray feature on your iron for those areas that need a little extra dampness.
- Strong Ironing Board ‚Äî try to stick to steady, even strokes when ironing your linen. So while not essential, an ironing surface that's not shaky or small will be a big help.
- Pressing Cloth ‚Äî it will give extra protection to your beloved linens by creating a buffer between the hot iron and the fabric. It will help to prevent the flattening of the linen fibres and shininess. Of course, make sure it's clean.
- Spray-on Starch or Fabric Sizing ‚Äî if needed, use it on tricky areas like collars and cuffs that you'd like to make smooth and crisp. The starch will also help to protect from any stains. Just make sure you always test out on an inside hem before using it.
How To Iron Your Linen
Sometimes the charming crumpled look of linen works well and fits the occasion. So when can you skip the iron? A relaxed summery blouse on a lunch date with friends is just the right balance of effortless elegance and not-trying-too-hard chic.
Yet when you're looking for your linen to be pressed and crisp, it's time to get the iron out! It shouldn't be a daunting task. If you follow a few simple tips & tricks for ironing your linen clothing, you'll be successful.
- Before you start ironing, give your linens a good spritz with plain water. Give extra attention and water to thicker areas like shirt collars, cuffs and pocket flaps. Wait about 5-10 minutes for the fibres to absorb the moisture.
- Turn your steam iron to the highest heat or linen setting, and you're ready to begin. Be careful, ensure your iron's faceplate and water are clean to prevent any ugly stains.
- Keep the iron moving in smooth and steady strokes. Don't stay in one spot for too long to avoid scorching your linen.
- Usually iron your clothes on the wrong side or inside out to prevent damage. Or use a pressing cloth.
- If there's any embroidery on the linen, iron the embroidered areas first. Otherwise, begin with the thicker areas like the collar and cuff etc.
- If stubborn creases and wrinkles are giving you problems then try to dampen the area with a little more water. It will help make the fabric more pliable and will ensure a smoother finish.
- Good news, the ironing is done! Now hang the linen on a padded garment hanger and allow it to cool down completely before putting it away. (try to resist the temptation to fold your freshly ironed linen, it will create crease lines).
- Finally, store it in an uncrowded area to minimise the chance of wrinkles.
Tips For Washing Linen And Reducing Creases
There are many little tricks you can do that will help keep the wrinkles in your linen at a minimum. As always, when it comes to washing your linens, follow the care instructions on your garment tag, although usually, a gentle wash in cold water works well.
Of course, if it says ""dry clean only"", you can't argue with that, and we recommend following the instructions. When it comes to our LUXMII linens, please click here for general garment care. Now for the washing tips:
- Don't overload your washing machine. It will result in lots of wrinkled clothes. Instead, give your linens plenty of room to move.
- Remove your washed linen clothing quickly from the washing machine. Creases won't have any time to set.
- Give handwashing a go if you really want to decrease the amount of balling, twisting and tugging the fabric will endure.
- While quick & convenient, it's safest to skip the dryer. The high heat may cause the fibres to shrink together and break (yikes!). Linen is best dried lying flat or hanging from a padded hanger. Gently work into the seams and hems of your linen clothing while it's still wet to smooth out any creases.
- To take good care of your linen and keep its high quality over time, use only mild detergent and never bleach.
Tricks To Avoid Ironing Linen
If you're not a fan of the iron or are short on time, there are plenty of ways you can avoid ironing your linen clothing altogether. It's not the end of the world. And you'll still end up looking like an effortlessly elegant style queen out and about on her Mediterranean summer holiday. Here are a few simple tricks to try:
- Use a fabric steamer. Especially a great idea when you're travelling. Your linen will not be perfectly crisp and pressed, but it will remove all the heavy wrinkles and creases.
- In the summer, it's so easy. Just spritz your favourite linen clothing with a little water and flatten it down. Any wrinkles or creases will quickly disappear. Great if you're on the go.
- Wear your linen; it improves with age like a good fine wine. The more you wash and wear it, the softer and more supple the fabric will become.
- Choose a linen blend for more wrinkle-prone pieces like trousers. It's much more forgiving. And will result in extra elasticity and give an overall smoother finish without any ironing. Here are some of our LUXMII linen blend favourites: Piega Trousers & Erato Wide Leg Linen Pant.
- In-between wears, store your pressed linen clothing on padded hangers or laying flat. Your linens will be perfectly crisp and ready to go as soon as you need them.
- Embrace the relaxed look. Linen's drape and texture add to its charm and authenticity‚Äîit's what sets the fabric apart from all the others and makes it special. Celebrate the uniqueness.
Conclusion: Ironing Linen Clothes
You can have it all with linen‚Äî unique textures, unparalleled breathability, and a smooth crispness. Sadly, ironing linen clothing is sometimes seen as a monumental task. Yet if you have the correct tools and remember a few simple tricks, you'll have no problems.
Here's a quick summary of the essentials when it comes to ironing linen successfully:
- Iron your linen clothing when it's damp. It will make smoothing out any creases simple.
- Use a steam iron. In order to iron linen the easy way, you need high heat and steam.
- Take care with your beloved linens. Iron them on the wrong side to minimise any damage. Or use a pressing cloth. Be especially careful with darker coloured linen, so its colours don't fade.
- Don't fold your freshly pressed linen. Instead, store it on padded garment hangers or lying flat. It will prevent any creases or wrinkles from setting stubbornly in place.
We hope we've given you plenty of tips and proven just how easy ironing your linen clothing is. Maybe you've even got a few special tricks of your own. Either way, enough ironing, it's time now to enjoy your life and take your linens along for the ride.

What's sage green? Basically, it's a type of green. Who would have thought? Then cool or warm undertones are added to the green to create a fresh, new colour that's something different from the standard primary green.
Is sage green a cool or warm colour?
Most sage greens are cooler, but they can also be warm. It depends on what kind of colour is infused into the green. The hottest sage greens at the moment have black and blue added to them to create an utterly sophisticated cool sage green.
Warmer sage greens that feel like sunshine are infused with reds, oranges and yellows to mellow out the green. Think of a softer khaki tone.
When you're styling with sage green, it helps to know what type of sage colour you're working with. Then you can incorporate those undertones into the rest of your look to create a seamless outfit that'll look like you studied colour theory at school. But really, you didn't.
What colours go with sage green clothing?
Neutrals
Creams, whites and blacks literally go with everything. They're the colours that can be seated next to anyone at a dinner party and happily chat away. So they also play nicely and look fabulous with sage green.
Creams will give you an understated, chick look. They're cool, calm and collected, with 0 unread emails in their inbox. For extra colour harmony, extend the creams to your accessories too.
Want your outfit to say clean & crisp? Then pair your sage greens with whites. They're refined, professional and always on time for every meeting. It‚Äôs amazing what a white linen top can do when paired with sage trousers.
If you're hoping for a bold outfit, then blacks are your golden ticket. The classic colour pairs effortlessly with sage green to deliver a modern aesthetic that will make you the unofficial style queen of your friend group.
Tonal - shades of green
Here's the secret trick to always look like you've just stepped off the runway, tonal styling. How contemporary does an all-white room look? That's the effect you'll get when you choose one colour, green and style it with matching tones and shades.
As well as we pair with the Greek islands, so do tonal greens with sage. Go for jumpsuits, rompers or a full sage trouser suit to rock the monochrome green look.
Emeralds look stunning with sage green for the cooler months. A sage green blazer styled over an emerald-coloured polo top and sage green linen pants is the definition of dressing to impress.
When the sun's shining, go for brighter, lighter greens to match your mood and the sunshine. Pastels are also having a major moment right now and, as luck would have it, pair fabulously with sage. A monochrome green outfit makes you feel as good as a post-exercise buzz.
Complimentary ‚Äì Bordeaux red
Let's put our funky art teacher glasses on and take a look at a colour wheel. When you're planning the colour of your outfits, it's a great place to start.
Complimentary colours are those that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. While they may seem like an unlikely pair at first, they'll create maximum impact.
Sage green's complimentary colour is a deep red. Pour yourself a glass of the finest Cab Sav or Shiraz for inspiration. When you're hoping to have all eyes on you, this is a winning combo. You could always go for bright red lips for a more subtle take on this colourful pairing.
Analogous ‚Äì sorbet yellow
Welcome to Summertime in an outfit. Pair sage green pants with a light sorbet yellow top. Effervescent, light and mood-boosting, this colour combo is a stunner. The only downside is it may make you hungry for gelato.
When we talk about colour wheels etc., it sounds like we actually know what you're talking about, and people are really impressed. As well as people thinking you're smart (always love some help in that department), it also helps make you look elegant without having to send countless photos of outfit ideas to your bestie before leaving the house.
(Does a quick Google search) Analogous colours are those that sit next to each other on the colour wheel. When you style them together, you'll create a soft, harmonious look. Light yellows and lime greens are analogous colours to sage green. So when paired together, they'll create an effortlessly chic outfit that will actually make you want to get up from the couch and venture outside.

Sage green linen dresses or satin ones make for super popular bridesmaids' dresses. All that's left is to combine with some stunning accessories. Strappy heels in both gold and silver would do just the trick.

https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/what-is-flax-linen,"What Is Flax Linen?
We answer the question, what is flax linen and look at its colourful history and what makes this fabric so special.
What in the world is flax?
Is it as life-changing as matcha lattes? Probably not, but it comes close. We'll give you a clue. Flax is a multi-hyphenate wonder brought to us by nature that can be both worn and eaten. Yes, eaten. Now, that's called multi-tasking.
So, if you're stuck on a desert island, can you take a bite out of one of your favourite linen dresses you just happened to get stranded in? Not quite, but you'll be at the destination of a lifetime, so make sure to take some final pictures. More on the eating part later.
Wearing flax linen is not for the faint of heart ‚Äî prepare to be copied. People just won't be able to help themselves. You'll look that good.
Now, no more mucking about. Let's get on with the blog. You'll learn (we're professors now) how flax linen is made, if there are any differences between flax linen vs linen, and so much more. Maybe we'll also throw in a corny joke or two and some pretty clothes to make the ride more enjoyable.
What is flax?
Flax comes from the flax plant. Who would have thought? Now, if only parallel parking were that simple. Flax naturally grows in Western Europe and China.
It's grown for two main purposes. One, it's used to make flax seeds, which is a nutritious food eaten by people and livestock. Sprinkle these seeds over a bowl of porridge ‚Äî delicious. When did this blog turn into the Martha Stewart show?
Two. Flax fibres are used to weave the wonderful fabric we all know and adore linen. (I Will Always Love You starts playing). More reasons why we love linen are hiding in our blog. Linen can then be woven into delightful clothing, bedding and table linens.
What is flax linen?
Flax linen is a heavenly textile crafted from the flax plant. It is a bast fibre, which means that it is made from the stems of the plant. All of linen's best characteristics, its strength, durability and moisture-wicking properties are thanks to the bast fibre.
Flax is known for its exclusivity and rarity. It represents only 1% of all the textiles in the world. When you wear linen, you also instantly become rare and exclusive just by way of association.
Wearing linen is like wearing a bit of history. It is the world's first textile, and people (us included!) continue to be obsessed with it. Worn by everyone from Alexander the Great to Julius Caesar and modern royals, linen is truly timeless. If it's good enough for them, why aren't you wearing it?
Linen is known to have been used as a textile since as early as 5000 BC by everyone from the Romans to the Ancient Egyptians. The Romans valued the textile so much that they named it the linum usitatissimum, which means the most useful.
Fun fact about linen that will hopefully come up at family Trivia night: the US dollar bill is made from the textile. Who knew? To be precise, it's made from 25% linen and 60% cotton. That's proof enough just how valuable the fabric really is.
Are all flax fibres the same?
The longer flax fibres are more expensive and premium. They're where linen's signature sheen comes from. In comparison, cotton is made from seed fibres, which are roughly 3.5cm long, while flax fibres are typically 90cm long.
Just like people are different, so is linen. Some of us wake up before our alarms and are basically considered superheroes, while others, well‚Ä¶ don't. The longer, unbroken line fibres from the flax plant are prized in the fashion world. These longer fibres are spun into yarn and used to make the finest linen tops.
Is flax linen different from linen?
No, flax isn't different from linen. Buzz words and marketing lingo strike again. Flax and linen both mean the same thing in the textile industry.
The word flax is added to some product descriptions to give the illusion that they're more natural or unprocessed. But that isn't the case.
When we're talking about fabrics, we could use the word flax to represent the plant before harvesting and processing. Then, use the term flax linen once the plant has been transformed into a textile.
The differences between flax and linen are imperceptible, if there are any at all. But what you should look out for when choosing linen clothing is the production process.
Most flax is grown in Western Europe. But then, the fibres can be shipped to China or India for processing. This is where quality and craftsmanship can be hindered. So it's essential to look closely at where your garment is made, even if it is European linen.
We can't guarantee there won't be any traffic at 5 pm, but we can stand behind the craftsmanship of our garments. LUXMII Linen is organic-certified and handmade by tailors in Portugal to ensure the finest quality.
How Is Flax Linen Made?
There's no straightforward recipe to make flax linen. It takes lots of expertise, time, good weather and plenty of hands that are willing to get dirty. But here are the key steps that determine the quality of linen.
- Retting
Once the flax plant is ready to be harvested, it undergoes a process called retting. It's when the flax plant is left out in the fields for a couple of weeks to allow the weather to break down the stalks and make them easier to harvest. This process needs to be done by a master. If they're left out too long, the stalks can rot and lose all their strength.
- Processing
After the retting stage, it's time to break down the woody stalks of the plant. This is often done by machines.
- Combing
Once crushed, the flax fibres go through a fine comb machine. This separates the long fibres from the short, undesirable ones.
- Spinning
The long line fibres are spun into yarn and then woven into the finest linen clothing. The shorter tow fibres don't go to waste. These are used to make coarser pieces, such as canvas.
Best Characteristics Of Linen
Strongest natural fibre
Wear your favourite linen pieces without a care in the world. The super long fibres and tight weave of linen, make it one of the most strongest and durable natural textiles. It's 30% stronger than cotton and can be worn again and again.
Thermo-regulating
Get a fabric that does all the hard work for you and keeps you looking your best while doing it. Linen works its magic and keeps you warm when it's cold and cool during the Summertime. You guessed it. This makes linen a truly seasonless fabric. Learn how to style linen dresses for women for every season.
Sweat-wicking
As if that isn't enough, linen is also naturally sweat-wicking. That means that if you're wearing your best black linen shirt and start getting hot, the sweat will disappear quicker than your phone's battery.
High on the sustainability meter
As if you need any more excuses to shop linen, it's also one of the most sustainable natural textiles on the market. How much fertilizer or pesticides are required to grow flax? Zero. That's the same number of things we dislike about linen, zero. Plus, it needs very little water. Often, natural rainfall is enough.
Biodegradable, renewable & recyclable
Linen can be described with only the most sparkling of adjectives. Biodegradable, renewable and recyclable, it's both good for the environment and fashion.
Conclusion: What Is Flax Linen?
Imagine if we had to run a lap of a footy field every time we said flax linen in this blog. Sadly for us, we're going to have to say it a few more times and then probably pass out from all that running.
What is flax linen?
- Flax linen is a textile made from the flax plant. Is it rude to call fabrics old? For linen, it's a bragging right. It's the world's oldest textile, proven to be more than 30,000 years old and still adored today. That's a huge achievement. Some of us can't even keep a plant alive for three days.
- Flax linen is a rare, completely natural fabric. It makes up just 1% of all textile production. So when you invest in linen, you're investing in exclusivity and quality.
- Linen fabric is made from the stems of the flax plant. These are woody and give linen all its amazing characteristics, such as durability and breathability.
- There is no real difference between flax linen and linen. Both words usually mean the same thing, AKA a fabric made from linen. Where there is some confusion is that brands use the term flax to make their products seem superior to others and more natural when they're not.
- Look at how linen clothing is made. This is one of the most important factors when determining the quality of the linen. Check where the linen is grown, whether it is organic and in what country the flax is processed. Then you'll get a clear picture of the quality.",What Is Flax Linen?,"We answer the question, what is flax linen and look at its colourful history and what makes this fabric so special."

Discover what to wear with wide leg linen pants and look perfect every time.
Are you a fan of easy, breezy pants you can simply slip on? So are we.
So that you get plenty of wear out of the pants in your closet, we‚Äôve got stylish outfit ideas for you to try. They‚Äôll leave you looking flawless, whatever the occasion, at the office or on the weekend.
Effortless yet elevated, wide leg linen pants are super comfy and can be dressed up or down without much fuss. Live in yours in the warmer months. Or with smart styling, they can also work in the wintertime. Find out how to wear linen in the winter with our blog post.
Stuck on ideas? We‚Äôve got you sorted with our stunner outfits that‚Äôll show you what to wear with wide leg linen pants. You‚Äôll have new, exciting ways to wear your favourite piece again and again.
How To Find The Best Wide Leg Linen Pants
Before we get to the ideas, let‚Äôs focus on the pants. Obviously, they‚Äôre the key to creating a successful outfit.
When it comes to wide leg linen pants, structured styles or floaty palazzos are the most popular. If you‚Äôre looking for a more formal, polished look, tailored options are usually the way to go. While floatier styles often double as resort wear or work better for evenings.
There‚Äôs a few crucial things to look at when searching for the perfect wide leg linen pants:
- what‚Äôs the width of the leg?
- what‚Äôs the best length?
- stick to high-waisted styles
Double Check The Width
The wider and more skirt-like the pants, usually the more casual the look. Think free-spirited fun. Also, if you‚Äôre looking for a fashion statement, the bigger, the better.
When you‚Äôre opting for wider silhouettes, it helps to keep the proportions in balance. Making your top half sleeker is a great place to start. Going for a simple fitted tee or tucking in a shirt is a simple way to balance out the look.
For the most versatility, go for wide leg shapes somewhere in between the extremes. A wider take on straight leg trousers works well and is still elegant and wearable.
What‚Äôs The Most Flattering Fit?
It‚Äôs rare to find wide leg pants that aren‚Äôt high-waisted, by far the trendiest and most flattering cut.
Why? They help balance out the width of the legs and also give the illusion of a cinched-in waist.
So, when putting together your outfits, try to style in a way that celebrates a high waist. Most of the tops that suit this style are cropped or otherwise tucked into the pants.
It‚Äôs up to you what kind of waist you‚Äôd like. For those after comfort, then obviously, stretch waistbands or drawstrings are a perfect choice. Or opt for a button-up waist for more formal occasions and to give extra structure and tailoring to your looks.
Now that we‚Äôve found the best pants, it‚Äôs time to show how versatile they really are. Let‚Äôs create some killer outfits you can add to your weekly line-up. Find out what to wear with wide leg linen pants below.
What To Wear With Wide Leg Linen Pants For PLAY
Wide Leg Linen Pants + Matching Linen Top
Matching sets are everywhere right now. And it‚Äôs easy to see why you simply slip on and go and instantly look fashionable. As a bonus, there‚Äôs no need to worry about colour matching.
Chose a relaxed boxy fit for your linen tops to balance out the flowy wide leg linen pants. Try this outfit in always classic white or any other earthy neutral works well too.
With linen on linen, you can‚Äôt lose. Cut from lightweight, natural fabric. It‚Äôs an everyday look that‚Äôll keep you cool but at the same time protected against the sun.
Dress up the look with dainty gold jewellery and leather slides, and you‚Äôre sorted for dinner plans. Or match with a wide-brimmed sun hat and a cute woven bag for running errands and coffee catch-ups.
On the plus side, this is an easy look that you can wear from season to season. Switch up the footwear to trendy sneakers to work for cooler weather. Or wear a tank top underneath for an extra layer of warmth.
Wide Leg Linen Pants + Summery Bra Top
Picture balmy days lounging at a rooftop bar with this chic little ensemble coming along. It‚Äôs all things fun. Plus, nothing‚Äôs fresher than all-white.
This breezy linen outfit metaphorically transports us poolside or somewhere fabulous in the Mediterranean. Yet it‚Äôs so easy. All you need is airy, wide leg linen pants and a super-cute bra top.
The proportions are balanced, and the bra top creates the illusion of an even longer silhouette. Can‚Äôt complain about that.
Glam it up with a wedge for the night. Or go for a seaside look with strappy flat sandals for the day. For some extra sparkle, give stacked pearl bracelets a try.
Wide Leg Linen Pants + Matching Linen Vest
Suits are such a snazzy part of every modern woman's wardrobe. The current trend is more fun than ever, with the waistcoat now having a major moment.
A pants & vest set is even better when it's cut from lightweight linen. It gives the normally structured suiting trend a more relaxed feel. Don't even get us started on how airy it feels on the skin while you're on the move.
Again, because of its cropped, tapered shape, a vest is the perfect companion to wide-legged pants. There's a balance, and it creates a cinched waistline.
This sleek look is versatile and can work for both business and fun. Depending on your work environment, it could wow at the office. Or match it with flat sandals and be ready for a lunch date. There are plenty of possibilities.
Pair with a matching blazer to adapt this chic set for the cooler temps. The silvery grey colour is a sophisticated take on neutrals that's multifunctional.
What To Wear With Wide Leg Linen Pants For BUSINESS
Wide Leg Linen Pants + Linen Button Down Shirt + Belt
Once you've nailed this look, you'll be wearing it again and again. It's the quickest way to achieve an understated vintage vibe. Plus, it's oh-so French.
The linen pants we've chosen feature front pleating that creates a flattering shape and adds a dressier feel to the entire outfit. Style it with a narrow belt, and you'll look impeccable.
Black linen pants for the office can get a little monotonous. So we've gone a little outside the comfort zone with an earthy tone that's modern but still looks professional.
When we're after something that goes with everything, it's all about a relaxed linen button-down. It doesn't get much easier or more elegant than this seasonless wardrobe essential. Here, it's tucked into linen trousers for extra polish.
Don this number for work or even for the weekend with a simple switch-up of footwear. Lace-up some brogues or slip into flat slides for the ideal outfit when you're out and about. For business, pair it with block heels or pumps.
Wide Leg Linen Pants + White Pretty Blouse
Don this number for work or even for the weekend with a simple switch-up of footwear. Lace-up some brogues or slip into flat slides for the ideal outfit when you're out and about. For business, pair it with block heels or pumps.
You can't go wrong with a floaty linen blouse for the office or whenever you want to make a good impression. Plus, when it's in classic white, it's hard to find bottoms it doesn't match with.
A soft ¬æ bishop sleeve and square neckline add a feminine touch to the blouse. When pairing with wide leg pants, make sure the top's cropped to create a silhouette that looks fab on every body type.
Just to show you something different, we've chosen a slightly shorter version of wide leg linen pants. They work well because of the dramatic wide leg. A little extra space calls for a gorgeous shoe that wants to be seen.
We suggest ballet flats for a more demure, professional look. Or try strappy gladiator sandals when you're ready to make a fashion statement and enjoy life in style.
Conclusion: What To Wear With Wide Leg Linen Pants
Outfits that include wide leg linen pants scream easy elegance. We can't wait for you to try some of our suggestions on the street and in real life.
But because of their unique shape, they can be a little trickier to style. So here's a quick recap of what to wear with wide leg linen pants. These are the key things to keep in mind:
- Choose tapered tops. To keep the proportions of an outfit balanced, go for shorter, more fitted tops to match your wide leg linen pants. Or tuck in a longer shirt.
- Linen on linen is a winning combo. If you're struggling with ideas, keep it simple and style linen pants with a linen top. It's a guaranteed way to look put-together and refined. Plus, it's super lightweight.
- The wider the leg, the higher the waist. For the most flattering fit, we recommend sticking to this advice. If your pants have an exaggerated wide leg, usually go for a high waist. It keeps the proportions of the whole look in harmony.
Remember, the outfits above are just recommendations, not strict rules.

There was a time in history when linen clothes for women was reserved for high society and the noble ‚Äì linen was once so precious that it was even used for wrapping the bodies of mummies in Egypt, contributing to the preservation of such ancient treasures. However the cultivation of flax spread throughout the 16th century and beyond, making linen more available. Fast forward to today and linen clothing is being rediscovered and redefined as a luxury fabric that is highly sustainable. Linen is a natural plant fibre that comes from the inner bark of flax stems. Our linen are grown and processed in Europe and require little to no pesticides, fertilisers or irrigation. It is then woven and made into beautiful linen clothing for women by talented family-run ateliers in Greece, Portugal and Hong Kong. Our linen is also Oeko-Tex certified (standard 100), which simply means that no harsh chemicals were used therefore deemed safe for humans. Furthermore, we collaborate with family-run factories with above-standard working conditions that employ less-intensive chemical processes (such as the dye they use to colour the fabric) and share our vision for a more sustainable future in the textile and garment industry for the production of linen clothing for women around the world.

10 products
The traditional slip dress has served a rather different purpose to what has become of it over the past decades in the world of apparel and fashion trends. Once made from silk or satin in a very simple and straight cut, the slip dress was only ever worn underneath a dress or skirt in order to help the garments fall on the body properly as well as to help avoid that static cling around the legs when wearing synthetic fibres. The slip was and still is worn to protect the skin from chafing against coarse fabrics such as wool and additionally to help absorb perspiration from materials that don't allow the skin to breathe. Nowadays, the slip dress has been redefined as a fashion statement, to be worn on its own. Luxmii's linen slip dress collection takes a modern approach to the traditional slip by playing with unique features and cuts that are fashionable enough to wear on its own. The beauty of a linen slip dress has one benefit that no other slip dress can compare to and that's all thanks to the flax plant's unique moisture wicking property. In other words, the linen slip dress is highly absorbent in nature, which means there is no need to layer your dress with a slip when it's hot.

https://eu.luxmii.com/pages/5-reasons-youll-love-linen-clothing,"1. Linen provides ultimate comfort & breathability
Linen is a natural fiber made from the flax plant. It's known for its breathability, which means it allows air to flow freely and doesn't trap heat. This makes linen clothing particularly comfortable for women who may experience hot flashes or increased body temperature.
2. They are perfect for working and casual wear
Linen clothing seamlessly bridges the gap between formal and casual wear. Its natural elegance can be dressed up for professional settings, making it suitable for work attire. At the same time, its relaxed and breezy appearance is perfect for casual outings or weekend get-togethers.
3. You look elegant and stylish throughout your day
Linen clothing often has a classic and timeless appeal. For women in their 30s and beyond, who may be looking for clothing that is both stylish and age-appropriate, linen offers a sophisticated option that never goes out of style.
4. They're Hypoallergenic
Suppressing bacteria, fungi, and pollen, linen helps prevent many allergic disorders and even aids in improving skin conditions like eczema and chronic rashes.
5. They last for years
Linen is a strong and durable fabric. When cared for properly, linen clothing can last for years without losing its shape or quality. This makes it a cost-effective choice in the long run, as women won't need to replace their linen garments frequently.

We are however, expanding our team internationally and as a result, will soon be operating from Europe in order to reduce our carbon footprint and localise our supply chain.

All orders are now exempt from any Customs, Duties and Taxes. If you are therefore purchasing from the following regions listed above, you will no longer need to pay international taxes and duties upon delivery.
Pre-Orders
Why do you offer pre-orders on some items?
Some of our styles are in extremely high demand and we regularly sell out within days of restocking so we decided to offer pre-orders on those styles for a certain timeframe.
This gives everyone a chance to order our most in-demand styles and guarantees the purchase so you dont miss out!
How do I place a pre-order?
Not all items are eligible for pre-order. The way you will know if the item you want to purchase is accepting pre-orders is if the 'ADD TO CART' button has been replaced with a 'PRE-ORDER' button.
Where can I find what items are available to pre-order?
You can visit our Pre-Order Page to view all styles that available to pre-order.
When will I receive my pre-order?
All pre-orders have an expected delivery time of approximately 4 weeks.
Please note: Depending on the volume of orders and time of the year, there's a chance your pre-order is delivered sooner. There is however, also a chance that your pre-order is delayed as a result of production and shipping delays, which is unfortunately beyond our control - you will however be informed by one of our team member's directly should this be the case.

Please note: if however, under extenuating circumstances such a significant delays well passed delivery timeframe, or a problem in production occurs, we will get in touch with your directly and give you the option to refund - this type of decision will be made at the discretion of LUXMII Linen.

More About LUXMII
When was Luxmii founded?

Where can you purchase Luxmii?
Genuine LUXMII linen can only be purchased on our website. We do not currently offer wholesale so our brand cannot be found in your local boutique. On occasion, we collaborate with stores for special events otherwise the full range can only be purchased online with us.
Where are you based?
LUXMII Linen is an international label founded in Australia. Our founder is Australian and all of our designs are created in both Australia and Portugal where we are based, so as to keep a close connection to our suppliers and producers who are all located in Europe.
Where are your products made?
We are very proud of the quality of our products as they are all produced with so much love and care by our exclusive master artisans. All products are made house at our atelier located in Portugal.
Where is your linen from?
Our linen is of very high quality and we work with a handful of Euoprean certified fabric suppliers that meet our standards. Depending on the style, you will find a variety of different linen fabric types from sheer gauze knits to heavyweight woven fibres.
How is LUXMII a sustainable brand?
At LUXMII, we only use environmentally friendly and cruelty-free processes for developing and producing every linen piece. We try our best to minimise our carbon footprint in every step of the business as well as in our personal lives.

(/Ààl…™n…ôn/) is a natural fiber made from the stems of a flax plant. Arguably one of the most sustainable textiles in the world, linen is natural, renewable, recyclable and biodegradable.
As one of the oldest and strongest natural fibers to ever exist, it is also zero-waste meaning that every part of the plant is used so as not to produce any waste. From textiles to edible food sources, every single component of flax can be used from its seeds to the production of oil.
It is also thermo-regulating, meaning that it will keep you cool when it‚Äôs warm and warm when it‚Äôs cool and hygroscopic meaning it rapidly absorbs moisture, absorbing up to 20% of its own weight before it even feels damp.
The cultivation of linen is the least water and energy intensive of all natural fibers which requires 400% less water than cotton. Being one of the most affordable natural fibers to grow, all that is needed is rainwater.
Up to 200,000 tonnes of CO2 captured per year
6.4L of water needed to produce 1 linen shirt vs 2700L for cotton
Flax cultivation is zero-waste, meaning 100% of the plant is utilized",Our Linen,LUXMII is a global brand with routes in both Australia and Europe. We are a sustainably luxury womenswear creating timeless & elegant wearable essentials made entirely from pure linen.

We also try our best to minimize our carbon footprint in every step of the business by eliminating as much single-use plastic as physically possible, partnering with local partners where we can and minimizing our waste by keeping a limited stockpile on hand.
Where are you based?
LUXMII is a global brand.
Our founder is Australian and all of our designs are created in both Australia and Europe. Our in-house team is split between Australia, Portugal and Greece so as to keep a close connection to our suppliers, partners and producers.

All of our linen is of high quality and some fabrics so rare, you can only find them here at LUXMII.

You Ask, We Answer.
Where is your linen from?
Being a brand that specializes in garments made only from linen, we use a wide range of linen from soft stone-washed woven fabrics to linen knits and yarn fibers.
All of our linen is of high quality and some fabrics so rare, you can only find them here at LUXMII.
Most of our linen is Oeko-Tex certified, and some are even organic depending on the style. We also produce using linen-blends such as GOTS certified cotton and even Wood Pulp.
Where are your products made?
We are very proud of the quality of our products as they are all produced with so much love and care by our production houses.
We partner with local family-run ateliers and manufacturers that follow a strict code of conduct set out by our company.
As we have experienced significant growth since the inception of our small business, we have brought on more partners to meet the increase in demand - we are proud to work with some of the most talented ateliers located in Portugal, Greece and Hong Kong.
How is LUXMII a sustainable brand?
We only use environmentally friendly, ethical and cruelty-free processes for developing and producing every linen piece.
We produce all of our clothing in linen as we believe it to be one of the most sustainable materials to ever exist. To find out more about why we believe in linen, please visit our About us page.
We also try our best to minimize our carbon footprint in every step of the business by eliminating as much single-use plastic as physically possible, partnering with local partners where we can and minimizing our waste by keeping a limited stockpile on hand.
Where are you based?
LUXMII is a global brand.
Our founder is Australian and all of our designs are created in both Australia and Europe. Our in-house team is split between Australia, Portugal and Greece so as to keep a close connection to our suppliers, partners and producers.
At current, our dispatch warehouse is located in Australia however we will be expanding into Europe in order to meet growing demand from other countries.
How is on-demand sustainable?
On-demand, if not, is the most sustainable production method out there because instead of making clothes en masse, we wait for orders to come in so we can produce exactly the amount that is asked for.

We are very proud of the quality of our products as they are all produced with so much love and care by our production houses.
We partner with local family-run ateliers and manufacturers that follow a strict code of conduct set out by our company.
