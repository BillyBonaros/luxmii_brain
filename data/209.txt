page_content="What is flax linen?\n- Flax linen is a textile made from the flax plant. Is it rude to call fabrics old? For linen, it's a bragging right. It's the world's oldest textile, proven to be more than 30,000 years old and still adored today. That's a huge achievement. Some of us can't even keep a plant alive for three days.\n- Flax linen is a rare, completely natural fabric. It makes up just 1% of all textile production. So when you invest in linen, you're investing in exclusivity and quality.\n- Linen fabric is made from the stems of the flax plant. These are woody and give linen all its amazing characteristics, such as durability and breathability.\n- There is no real difference between flax linen and linen. Both words usually mean the same thing, AKA a fabric made from linen. Where there is some confusion is that brands use the term flax to make their products seem superior to others and more natural when they're not." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/what-is-flax-linen', 'title': 'What Is Flax Linen?', 'description': 'We answer the question, what is flax linen and look at its colourful history and what makes this fabric so special.'}
