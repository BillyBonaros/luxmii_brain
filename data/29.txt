page_content="Both fabrics are natural but have very different environmental footprints. These are some of the major positives of linen:\n- Zero-Waste: all parts of the flax plant can be used to create valuable things such as textiles, food, seeds and oil. This means that there's no waste in the production of linen. We love a guilt-free purchase.\n- Low Water Use: producing linen uses the least amount of water and energy compared to all the other natural fibres. Linen requires 400% less water than cotton and 400% less stress.\n- Natural Cultivation: growing linen's easier than trying to keep an indoor plant alive. Why? It's a super low-maintenance crop (can't say the same for us!). There's no need for artificial irrigation, pesticides or chemicals when growing or producing linen fibres. So linen gets an A+ for style as well as an A+ for sustainability." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/cotton-vs-linen-why-we-love-linen', 'title': 'Cotton vs Linen: Why We Love Linen?', 'description': 'Cotton vs linen.
