page_content="The word flax is added to some product descriptions to give the illusion that they're more natural or unprocessed. But that isn't the case.\nWhen we're talking about fabrics, we could use the word flax to represent the plant before harvesting and processing. Then, use the term flax linen once the plant has been transformed into a textile.\nThe differences between flax and linen are imperceptible, if there are any at all. But what you should look out for when choosing linen clothing is the production process.\nMost flax is grown in Western Europe. But then, the fibres can be shipped to China or India for processing. This is where quality and craftsmanship can be hindered. So it's essential to look closely at where your garment is made, even if it is European linen.\nWe can't guarantee there won't be any traffic at 5 pm, but we can stand behind the craftsmanship of our garments. LUXMII Linen is organic-certified and handmade by tailors in Portugal to ensure the finest quality." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/what-is-flax-linen', 'title': 'What Is Flax Linen?', 'description': 'We answer the question, what is flax linen and look at its colourful history and what makes this fabric so special.'}
