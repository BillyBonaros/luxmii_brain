There are so many we have had to make a list.\n- Outstanding quality: making everything in-house means our pieces will be created by talented artisans who are like family to us. They live and breathe their craft infusing extra skill and time into every stitch. We are elevating the quality of our pieces with traditional cutting methods and French seams that create a smooth, luxurious finish.\n- No bulk stock: we are serious about creating more sustainable, conscious fashion. LUXMII Linen designs will be produced in micro-batches and made to order so that very little stock will be held at our Low inventory means we have completely eliminated one of the most negative issues in the fashion industry — deadstock. With most deadstock ending up in landfill, we are extra proud of this fact.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/atelie-de-luxmii', 'title': 'We’re Moving Our Operations and Here’s Why It’s Important', 'description': 'Meet Ateliê de LUXMII.
