page_content='Meet Ateliê de LUXMII. Bonus points for correct pronunciation. Our very own production house and dispatch facility in Portugal, Europe. It is now where all LUXMII Linen pieces will be designed, cut, packed and shipped — which is rare in the modern fashion business.\nBy upgrading our operations, we will have more control over how we create clothes. Moving allows us to work closely with our artisan tailors and develop stronger connections with our fabric suppliers, enhancing the quality of LUXMII pieces to sumptuous new heights.\nIn the spirit of transparency, we are excited to hand you the keys (metaphorically) and show you around as we set a new standard for quality. So you can see the extra time, precision and attention to detail that goes into every garment.\nMost brands, when they grow, push harder and faster, and ultimately, what starts to fall is the quality of their products. But we are taking a more unconventional path to success that does not compromise.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/atelie-de-luxmii', 'title': 'We’re Moving Our Operations and Here’s Why It’s Important', 'description': 'Meet Ateliê de LUXMII.
