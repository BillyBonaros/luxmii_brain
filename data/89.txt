page_content='The best shape to consider for linen tops is a loose-fitting silhouette. The greater the contrast between the fit of the two different tops, the greater the style. Our Relaxed Pallocino Top or Hecate Kimono Top would be superb linen to try this technique with — as their oversized shape and kimono sleeves lend themselves perfectly to be layered over the top of a long-sleeved cotton shirt.\nAnother method for wearing linen in winter is to choose long sleeve tops. Perhaps, you even own some thicker, heavier linens which would suit well for the winter. Pair this with jeans, tucked in with a belt or worn loosely. And voilà, you have yourself a fine looking winter outfit.\nThink along the lines of our Gaia Tunic. Or our Ragazzo Shirt with a simple cami underneath and a pair of high-waisted jeans — splendid.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/how-to-wear-linen-in-winter', 'title': 'How To Wear Linen In Winter', 'description': 'Wearing linen clothing in the colder months... can it be done!?
