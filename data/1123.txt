page_content='Where are you based?\nLUXMII is a global brand.\nOur founder is Australian and all of our designs are created in both Australia and Europe. Our in-house team is split between Australia, Portugal and Greece so as to keep a close connection to our suppliers, partners and producers.\nAt current, our dispatch warehouse is located in Australia however we will be expanding into Europe in order to meet growing demand from other countries.\nHow is on-demand sustainable?\nOn-demand, if not, is the most sustainable production method out there because instead of making clothes en masse, we wait for orders to come in so we can produce exactly the amount that is asked for.\nThis way we donâ€™t have any leftover stock or fabric - most brands burn this or take it to landfills, a massive threat to our ecosystem.\nWhat are your shipping & returns terms?\nAll orders are shipped from our warehouse in Australia.\nWe offer both Express and Standard shipping on all orders.
