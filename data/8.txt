page_content="We are bucking trends and going the other way. As we grow, we are paying even more attention to the quality of our garments because we know it is what makes us special.\nMoving our operations to Portugal allows us to have a very hands-on approach at each step of the production process, guaranteeing greater quality on all levels as we continue to perfect our craft. It is a lifelong commitment and a new home, not a one-off summer romance.\nAteliê de LUXMII is where we have nurtured a close connection with fabric supply chain partners and talented artisans. So now we can focus on what is most important to us, creating consciously-made linens defined by their flawless quality.\nLUXMII Linen is saying yes to exquisite artisan-made linens and a big NOPE to mass, bulk-produced fast fashion where the stitching unravels after the first wash. For those that don't fit the typical size range, say yes to custom sizing solutions. Our talented tailors can create a fit that works for you." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/atelie-de-luxmii', 'title': 'We’re Moving Our Operations and Here’s Why It’s Important', 'description': 'Meet Ateliê de LUXMII.
