This next one will turn you into a lover.\nLinen is naturally moisture-wicking, drawing moisture and sweat away from the skin. You'll feel cool even if you've been running errands all day and carrying bags and bags of shopping.\nCotton can also wick moisture, but not as expertly as linen. In fact, the stats show that people dressed in linen sweat less than people wearing cotton. Looking fresh without trying? Sign us up.\nLinen Is Thermo-Regulating\nLinen is the most thermo-regulating fabric you can find. That's a fancy way of saying it's a master at controlling temperature. So it keeps us cool when it's warm and warm when it's cool. That's another reason to wear linen all year round." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/cotton-vs-linen-why-we-love-linen', 'title': 'Cotton vs Linen: Why We Love Linen?', 'description': 'Cotton vs linen.
