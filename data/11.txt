page_content='- More new designs that you love: Fresh new styles in our core fabrics will be launched every month. Just another benefit of keeping operations in-house. Our team will be on the ground in the middle of the action. So, you can shop more of what you love as we get direct feedback. Play the tape back. Remember when we said you could have it all? Because we only produce in line with customer demand, there is no waste or guilt, unlike fast fashion.

Call us passionate or controlling, but we are beyond excited to perfect the quality of our garments to whole new levels.\nHere’s a simple breakdown of the process for anyone still reading. There are, hopefully, still a few. Keep in mind every step is happening in one place, Ateliê de LUXMII, which isn’t common.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/atelie-de-luxmii', 'title': 'We’re Moving Our Operations and Here’s Why It’s Important', 'description': 'Meet Ateliê de LUXMII.
