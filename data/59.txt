page_content="Don't exaggerate too much when trying to shrink your linens in the washing machine and dryer. A small increase in temperature can create plenty of shrinkage. Start a washing cycle on warm heat (40-50C)and put your linen shirt into the machine. Close the washing machine door. (the reminder is for us; you probably don't need it).\nFinish off in the dryer at a low heat setting. Somewhere around 30C would be a good start. The higher the heat and the longer the time, the more shrinking. We recommend gradually working your way to your preferred size and fit so there aren't any surprises.\nHow many sizes will linen shrink?\nWhile we can predict that another mega-celebrity will come out with a skincare line by the end of the year (huge eye roll), we can't predict with complete accuracy how much your linen clothing will shrink." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/how-to-shrink-linen', 'title': 'DIY Projects: How To Shrink Linen', 'description': "Discover how to shrink linen at home for best results that won't cause any headaches."}
