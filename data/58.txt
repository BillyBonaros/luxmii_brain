Obviously, if you have linen pants that need to be shortened, getting them hemmed is the way to go. But even if you're hoping for a more cinched-in waist, an experienced seamstress will be able to make it happen.\n2. By hand\nThis method is the most gentle. So use it on all the pieces that you love and treasure. Delicate linen tops and dresses are best shrunk with this method. Soak your linens in warm water. But make sure it's not boiling hot. Next, leave your linen in the water for roughly 10 hours. Stir every so often. This method allows you to check up regularly on your linen and see how it is progressing. Then, air dry the linen.\n3. Using the washing machine & dryer\nCaution. This method comes with a warning written in big red letters. Only use this method if you've tried shrinking by hand and it didn't work." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/how-to-shrink-linen', 'title': 'DIY Projects: How To Shrink Linen', 'description': "Discover how to shrink linen at home for best results that won't cause any headaches."}
