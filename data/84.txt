Extra points for soft pleating or puffed sleeves. Pair the cropped top with a midi skirt to elongate the body and balance out the breezy fit of the blouse. Keep to neutral colours for a fresh, seamless look.\n- Crisp linen button-down + dressy pants — a structured and collared linen button-down is the simple answer to elevated workwear. Pair it with dressy pants or a pencil skirt for a go-to office look. Elevate it with dainty jewellery.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/how-to-wear-a-linen-shirt', 'title': 'Consistent Classics: How To Wear A Linen Shirt Like A Style Master', 'description': 'Find out how to wear a linen shirt so gorgeously that you’ll never run out of outfit ideas again.'}
