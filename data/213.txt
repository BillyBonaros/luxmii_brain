A wider take on straight leg trousers works well and is still elegant and wearable.\nWhat’s The Most Flattering Fit?\nIt’s rare to find wide leg pants that aren’t high-waisted, by far the trendiest and most flattering cut.\nWhy? They help balance out the width of the legs and also give the illusion of a cinched-in waist.\nSo, when putting together your outfits, try to style in a way that celebrates a high waist. Most of the tops that suit this style are cropped or otherwise tucked into the pants.\nIt’s up to you what kind of waist you’d like.
