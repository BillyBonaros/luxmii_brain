Arguably one of the most sustainable textiles in the world, linen is natural, renewable, recyclable and biodegradable.\nAs one of the oldest and strongest natural fibers to ever exist, it is also zero-waste meaning that every part of the plant is used so as not to produce any waste. From textiles to edible food sources, every single component of flax can be used from its seeds to the production of oil.\nIt is also thermo-regulating, meaning that it will keep you cool when itâ€™s warm and warm when itâ€™s cool and hygroscopic meaning it rapidly absorbs moisture, absorbing up to 20% of its own weight before it even feels damp.' metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/pages/our-linen', 'title': 'Our Linen', 'description': 'LUXMII is a global brand with routes in both Australia and Europe.
