page_content="To be a little chic and a little edgy, all at the same time, try wearing a linen dress over a fitted top. Very 90s. And adding some nostalgia is always a fun!\nFor those chilly days, slip on a linen dress over a pair of warm leggings or tights. You'll be simultaneously comfortable and fashionable. An outfit like this works incredibly well with tunic-style dresses, like our Calliope Tunic.\nWhy not combine a classic double-breasted wool coat with a linen dress? You'd never think twice about combining such a coat with a cotton, silk or wool dress — and it works just as well with linen. Remember:\n- the longer the hemline, the warmer you'll be\n- for a more formal look, combine the coat with a more structured grand style of linen\nOur Safari Wrap Dress, Rhodes Layered Dress or Hera Drawstring Dress would be perfect additions. To be particularly daring and extravagant, you could pair them with a magnificent shearling or faux wool coat. The contrast in textures and styles will add glamour." metadata={'url': 'https://eu.luxmii.com/blogs/news/how-to-wear-linen-in-winter', 'title': 'How To Wear Linen In Winter', 'description': 'Wearing linen clothing in the colder months... can it be done!?
